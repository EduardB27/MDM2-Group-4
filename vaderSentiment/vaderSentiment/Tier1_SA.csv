33,Knightsbridge Hotel, The room that you could eat your breakfast in was far too small for a busy hotel so we had breakfast in our suite which was lovely but if I had to gripe it was slightly uncomfortable perched on a sofa and bending down onto a coffee table,-0.1432
34,Knightsbridge Hotel, Nothing in regards the hotel although now I know there are no front facing deluxe rooms I would reserve a different room type next time Its also a bit expensive in our view but at least you know that up front ,-0.1531

53,Knightsbridge Hotel, The English breakfast was disappointing in that it was undercooked to the point that we both sent it back To be fair we weren t charged for it but as we were only there for one night and we both really enjoy our food and look forward to a cooked breakfast when away it was a disappointing finale to the trip,-0.1054

65,Knightsbridge Hotel, Unfortunately a lot of things But most importantly There are security issues with the hotel During my first night a housekeeper just barged into the room unannounced and unapologetic about it while I was sleeping Given that this is not a standard practice of any hotel esp that they should always knock before they enter things got worse The last day of my check out they checked in a guest into one of my rooms I booked two at 10 AM BEFORE I check out I even entered the room thinking it was still mine with my key and found the new guest already sleeping on the bed and shocked when they saw me come into the room That was completely absurd and never heard of especially in a supposedly 5 star hotel When I checked into this hotel twice I was given the rooms after 4pm so to actually check in a guest into an unchecked room before 10AM was a rip off to me To make things even worse after at least 15 minutes of arguing with the manager about it they were not taking responsibility he did not apologize for this until I demanded an apology I have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior of staff ever in any of my travels around the world and in any hotels I have been to I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone Other things worth mentioning rooms are the smallest I have seen out of all the hotels I have been in London Breakfast was very limited and dull Sometimes it was a little challenging getting a taxi to the hotel ,-0.975

202,The London EDITION, Overpriced and only deserving of a 4 star rating The superior room we got was tiny horribly hot with a view over the service yard The room didn t have basic facilities like an iron and coffee or tea facilities which in a 5 star was a bit poor The decor was so sparse and cheaply finished in the bedrooms felt more IKEA than premium You also need to reserve in advance a table in the punch bar even if you are a hotel guest which would have been helpful to know before arriving or even when checking in but we only found this out when we went to go for a drink and were rudely turned away Overall an underwhelming 4 star hotel ,-0.5647

3716,citizenM London Bankside, Room very small and cramped Bed squashed against wall which wasn t ideal for getting in and out of bed It felt like being in a tiny caravan Our city view was a view of the rooms opposite so needed to keep blind down for privacy hence making the room dark Hardly any staff around very minimalistic no tea and coffee facilities in room although a mini bar with a few very strange drinks that were not to our liking The bathroom was a toilet and shower in a cubicle which wasn t very private and the basin was in the bedroom Very bizarre hotel and not certainly worth the money ,-0.786

3720,citizenM London Bankside, If you are looking for spacious rooms with good facilities then this is not the hotel for you The room was VERY SMALL indeed the room is the width of the bed and the toilet and shower facilities were behind a glass screen door rather than in a separate bathroom Space was at such a premium that the sink was actually in the bedroom There was no room to store suitcases other than on the floor and no enclosed clothes hanging space merely a clothes rail with very limited hanging space On arriving in our room we found that there are no tea coffee facilities a major omission but there is a fridge stocked with a limited range of soft drinks However the fridge was not working and we reported this to a member of staff to no avail Many of the innovative features in the room are operated through an iPad Blinds temperature lights TV but the tablet would not hold its charge indeed after an all day charge it was still holding less than a 25 charge which meant that it lasted barely a few hours before it needed recharging making it almost useless This is not a hotel that I would stay in again ,-0.719

3736,citizenM London Bankside, We were at the front of the hotel on a low floor and it was really noisy You could hear everything outside and even though it was a Sunday night it sounded like building works were going on all night They did offer us to change room but by then our baby was asleep and waking her to move would have been even more trouble Rooms are very small and beds not great if there are 2 of you as one of you has to climb over the other to get out of bed ,-0.8666

8946,Edouard 7 Paris Op ra, I booked my room and paid for deluxe room with balcony When I arrived to the hotel the lady on the counter ignored the balcony so I have to remind her about it but she told me your booking without balcony So I showed her the booking confirmation then she said oh we did not get details from booking com even I paid for my room 6 months ago Then she said actually it s booking com problem After all of that she said i need to tallk to thr manager then she came up with two choices either to take room without balcony or other room with hole take you out the room which was awful I have no choice so I have to accept anything they offer Was very bad experience ,-0.9299

9154,citizenM Tower of London, Something was strange about the elevators You would call them but then the button light would go out and you would have to call them again Over the speakers you could hear the continuous automated elevator doors announcements doors opening and doors closing day and night Probably isn t needed so much at night when it s very quiet and it sounds louder ,-0.1027
9156,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom is particularly small but functional,0
9157,citizenM Tower of London, Cleanliness was not good Our bins were not emptied even though our room had been serviced The toilet stank I had to leave a note asking for it to be disinfected so the stench of old urine could be removed After the toilet was disinfected the bathroom was left with white streaks of the disinfectant all over we had to wipe these off ourselves Also the breakfast is a rip off As if the 13 pounds p p charged for breakfast is not high enough the hotel charges an extra 3 pounds if you decide to book the breakfast on the day Better go to 1 of the many places nearby for a good breakfast for better value ,-0.0942
9161,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing I m aware of ,0
9162,citizenM Tower of London, Slightly mesmerising on arrival as all technology orientated and as we had two separate bookings made for over three nights which we wished to amalgamate so we kept the same room we were able to check in only for our first night and then needed to look for assistance to sign in for the following two nights As there was no reception this took a little time ,-0.296

9190,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing,0
9191,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing ,0
9195,citizenM Tower of London, Water dripping and running from the ceiling I guess it was the air con unit above the bathroom door but not sure Dripped all night and mopped it up with towels a couple of times No time to tell anyone but if I d arrived earlier I would have asked for another room ,-0.642
9201,citizenM Tower of London, The bar up stairs not being open all the time I mean you rave about the view then you can t see it because the bars shut ,0
9202,citizenM Tower of London, Only one downside for us poor sighted people No magnifying mirror on the wall in the room ,-0.743
9205,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing,0
9208,citizenM Tower of London, Not for older people had to ask for a change of room as all rooms apart from disabled could only be accessed by one side This meant climbing over ones partner if the bathroom facilities were needed All things controlled by computer Too gimmicky,0
9210,citizenM Tower of London, There was no kettle in the room And I have to have a cup of tea in the mornings before I can do anything ,-0.296
9211,citizenM Tower of London, The only down side was the room A The bed was wall to wall making it difficult to get into and out of B the room air conditioning was useless the minimum you could turn it down to was 18 degrees making it uncomfortable and unable to sleep during the night on really hot nights we encountered should be able to take down to at least 15 degrees c the shower was good but the toilet was in the shower and you had to leave the shower cubicle area and go into the bedroom area to use the washbasin and mirror tight squeeze,-0.4215
9212,citizenM Tower of London, Shower toilet wet room not very clean on arrival and the iPad that is heavily advertised as the room controller for tv lighting temperature was flat with a faulty charging dock Was swiftly swapped by staff but maybe should be checked when housekeeping are turning the room around ,-0.1992
9216,citizenM Tower of London, The only thing I ever miss in these hotels is a kettle in the room ,-0.1531
9217,citizenM Tower of London, Room cleaning seems to only happen every couple of days and wasn t very thorough ,0
9218,citizenM Tower of London, The room is quite small for a long weekend it turned just right but we hardly had any luggage ,0
9219,citizenM Tower of London, No room service or late night food snack bar ,-0.296
9222,citizenM Tower of London, We were a group of friends travelling together some of us sharing rooms We did not like the bathroom that was enclosed in frosted glass sometimes you need a bit more privacy Frosted glass bathroom doors is an awful trend that needs to go There is no light dedicated to just the bathroom so if you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you will have to turn on the mirror light which is part of the common area There is a curtain that acts as a partition but its transparent so not functional ,-0.237
9223,citizenM Tower of London, Facility to have a hot drink in room Not always convenient to go down to the ground floor when you are half dressed just to get a cup of tea ,0
9225,citizenM Tower of London, fire alarm in the middle of the night had this happen a few properties over the years Do feel on this occasion communication could be better at the time when outside no communication no one at a defined gathering point from Staff young staff member at front door came out side just shrugged her shoulders when asked anything people return inside when alarms went off with no real communication from mgmt at the time although nice msg the following morning from mgmt Just feel something they can learn from ,-0.4043
9226,citizenM Tower of London, My only fault would be that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in our room ,-0.5994
9227,citizenM Tower of London, Awful experience from start to finish Despite being very expensive for what was offered the staff were unable to help when it became clear my original booking was messed up I had to have someone else sort it out online Rooms are very small completely soleless and clincal a good portrayal of the death room from the movie Soylent Green The room access card needed for virtually everything stopped working and I became stuck in a lift for 20 minutes resulting in my being late for an important event No apology received just uniniterested hosts I think they re called Alarms went off at 02 25 in the morning due to someone having a shower and the place had to be evacuated A complete lack of information or staff on hand to aid those who needed it didn t help there was no guidance nothing On re admittance the vagrants were allowed in as well and spent 30 minutes harrassing tired and already irritated guests for money there was no one to remove them perhaps due to the almost complete absence of staff The format for this hotel is a victory of marketing and glitz over substance Don t be fooled by the colourful busy exterior or friendly welcoming website page it s anything but that Regrettably the rating indicator doesn t offer anything more damning that a frowning face otherwise I would have clicked that I really was disgusted with the whole experience Apparently we are advised the sister hotel in Paris has been completely remodelled following similar client experiences CAVEAT EMPTOR ,-0.957
9228,citizenM Tower of London, Would have liked more of a private bathroom setting and wash clothes for the shower The fire alarm went off at 2 30AM and there was no announcement of false alarm ,-0.6808
9231,citizenM Tower of London, To me the hotel is top but the rooms are small and you can hear every sound from the toilet I point this so no one is disappointed ,-0.82
9232,citizenM Tower of London, Nil,0
9233,citizenM Tower of London, The rooms are rather small which doesn t bother me personally since I m there to see the city not the room but if you plan on spending much time in your room it might be a little too small The toilet shower combination is not very usual for this price range in my opinion I prefer a separate toilet with a proper door ,-0.1779
9235,citizenM Tower of London, Can t say ,0
9237,citizenM Tower of London, There were works going on all night at the tube station next door which meant we could hear stuff going on right outside,0
9238,citizenM Tower of London, there were no kettles in the room so you would need to get some from the reception bar area downstairs ,-0.296
9239,citizenM Tower of London, Not enough privacy when going to the toilet,0
9242,citizenM Tower of London, No privacy in bathroom due to large gap under the door and washbasin in bed room shower temperature control faulty kept burning us using toilet awkward as floor was continuously wet from the shower had to ask for toiletries noisy fan in shower continued all night no tea making facility in room so had to keep getting dressed and going to cafe to bring tea to room and cost 2 a cup Even Travelodge give you a kettle Cups in room were not removed by staff which spoilt effect of freshly made up room ,-0.6908

9245,citizenM Tower of London, NOTHING,0
9249,citizenM Tower of London, Food and drinks can be a bit expensive however there are plenty of places nearby to eat and drink ,0

9254,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast items were tasty but more on sweeter side Can do to add little Indian spices to some dishes ,0
9255,citizenM Tower of London, Had to leave our room to get tea and coffee which you pay for and the food area had limited choice and very little information about what was available ,-0.3612
9257,citizenM Tower of London, no kettle in the room would have liked a normal way to control lights and TV ie just a tv remote not the ipad which was really confusing ,-0.1513
9258,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are quite small and everything is switched on off by IPad which may be difficullt for older generation ,0
9262,citizenM Tower of London, The room could ve been just a little bigger and I would ve preferred the sink to be actually inside the bathroom ,0
9267,citizenM Tower of London, hall was too scented poor dinner just a few options ,-0.4767
9269,citizenM Tower of London, The only minor thing that could be added to the room is coffee tea amenities ,0
9270,citizenM Tower of London, Privacy of bathroom Size but a typical London room,0
9271,citizenM Tower of London, Courtyard rooms feel stuffy and closed out Rooms are on the small side ,0
9272,citizenM Tower of London, The food options in the lounge are great but unfortunately not everything is available 24hours Also understandably high tech comes with some trade offs when the pad with which you control the functions of the room is out of battery you re out of some options until it is recharged ,-0.1406
9273,citizenM Tower of London, The bed arrangement it is only accessible on one side the other three are fixed to a wall Meaning it is unsuitable to less able people The room is also tiny ,0
9275,citizenM Tower of London, Room was unexpectedly small The bed was the entire width of the room which meant someone had to climb over the other to get out As we were travelling for some months it was difficult to unpack as there are no shelving or the like ,-0.296
9278,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing,0
9279,citizenM Tower of London, in bedroom did not electric teapot ,0
9283,citizenM Tower of London, Room rather small not much room for clothes and Suitcases etc Also the fact that the double bed is situated so that one person has climb over another if wanting to go to the bathroom during the night ,0

9286,citizenM Tower of London, The pillows on the bed look a little dirty could probably do without them ,-0.3832
9293,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing,0
9295,citizenM Tower of London, as usual breakfast is expensive at CitizenM elevators can be slow waiting time,0
9296,citizenM Tower of London, 1 Wash basin right in the room toilet and shower removed from the room by a thin glass wall only 2 Week shower and toilet ventilator 3 Window to the passage no view 4 Non opening window no fresh air ,-0.4874
9298,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was very confortable but we found the room quite small bed stuck between the window and the walls ,-0.4396
9300,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing 10 10 ,0
9301,citizenM Tower of London, No kettle or coffee machine in the room,-0.296
9302,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was a little firm for me and as its placed sideways across the room from wall to wall whoever is laying closest to the window has to climb over the other person There didn t seem to be separate lights for the bathroom so if you need to get up in the night you have to put the small lamp on which again wakes the other person The main problem for me though was that the ventilation blows directly on to the bed and you can t can t turn it off I personally can t stand being in a draught so it meant I was cold for most of my stay or had to burrow under the covers The room wasn t cold I turned the temperature up and it responded very quickly it was just the ventilation,-0.4019
9304,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing ,0
9305,citizenM Tower of London, There was a fridge in the room but apparently they had taken out the kettles due to a problem with them setting off the fire alarms Tea and coffee were available 24hours a day downstairs but you have to pay for them I very much object to paying over 2 pounds for a cup of tea As the room is so small there is no room for your suitcase That is no problem if you are there for a few days as I was and can put your clothes away in the storage area If you were staying overnight there is not enough room to have your case on the floor and live out of it ,-0.8693
9306,citizenM Tower of London, Could have done with a longer stay ,0
9308,citizenM Tower of London, The room was very compact,0
9310,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing at all,0
9311,citizenM Tower of London, the fire alarm that went off as soon as I started resting and the staff was unable to stop it for about half an hour was in the afternoon and also noisy maintenance in the afternoon,-0.7717
9313,citizenM Tower of London, Minor remarks to the room well although cleverly designed still on the border between minimalistic and claustrophobic No fresh air Bed is XXXL size and comfy but if u want to use the TV make sure to place the weakbladder nightwaterdrinker at the outer side No separate illumination in the bath room at least i couldn t find a separate switch Sounds much worse than it is in reality most probably u will not notice these minorities during a 3 nights stay ,-0.325
9314,citizenM Tower of London, Unfortunately you couldn t have a look at the Thames or at the Tower of London because the riverside is reserved by a private society and the roof is not accessible ,-0.34
9319,citizenM Tower of London, They have thought of everything ,0

9794,citizenM Tower of London, The service is awful lots of employees don t speak english fluent and they don t know the prices of the food They are rude don t allow to drink even a coffee bought outside of their facilities One of the guys Harrisson seems to have psychological problems when treating with the guests he laughs and makes awkward comments constantly Also no one is very helpful they create trouble instead of solving them The bathroom is a semitransparent cabin with no sound isolation so the person outside in the room hears everything I would never come back ,-0.2926

9800,citizenM Tower of London, Security here is very lax we were twice bothered by a guy approaching people and asking for money downstairs none of the staff seemed to notice him even when he appeared to be trying to nick stuff from someone s backpack at the bar Anyone can get up into the hotel rooms via the lifts or stairs as there is no ID or security In addition the food downstairs is INCREDIBLY overpriced 23 for a self serve English breakfast and the iPad controls of the room while very amusing didn t actually work properly e g the air conditioning did not respond at all The rooms are basically pods and I would not really recommend for a long stay or for older people who might have trouble clambering over one another to get into the beds which are accessible from one side only ,-0.6451

9812,citizenM Tower of London, There was a loud banging noise in our room throughout the day and night which was possibly the air conditioning unit of linked to the water supply which did wake us up during the night,0
9816,citizenM Tower of London, There was a power outage not the fault of the hotel but as a result even the water did not work It highlighted the over dependance on technology as it was not possible to open the blinds or a window and there was no air conditioning A back up power generator might be worth the investment If the power cut had not occurred the review would have been even more positive but not being able to wash is a big negative even if the hotel cannot be responsible ,-0.561

9872,citizenM Tower of London, There was a mix up with my booking my fault I booked in for one week after the actual date I was arriving Thankfully there were rooms in the hotel but I was charged just short of 100 extra for this As it was a genuine mistake I would not turn up to London without a booking I thought they could have charged me the same but instead they charged me extra I had no choice but to agree Also the canary warf rooms are looking onto a building site This needs to be changed temporarily whilst work is going on I changed my room ,-0.802

10816,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The suite had a first room that was basically empty It had a small couch but that was it Seemed like a waste of room and made the place look spartan Definitely would not pay extra for it as there appeared to be no difference other than this extra room There was no bath in the room unlike the regular rooms Furthermore there was no full sized mirror ,-0.6435

11053,The Curtain, The staff didn t really know what they were doing as it was a new hotel I can understand this The rooms are incredibly small and impractical For example the basin is so big but there is no benchspace to put your toiletries and there is no door on the toilet There is a door to the bathroom but it doesn t go fully to the ground which means the toilet lacks privacy The food from the rooftop restaurant was average One of the lifts wasn t working for our entire stay ,-0.6808
11054,The Curtain, Images used on website are the development plans for the hotel the reality is far from impressive The pool is no bigger than a bath a kin size suite consists of a double bed in a bow room in which you have to walk through the curtains to get around the bed and a TV inconveniently stashed in the corner which is also becomes an obstacle you have get around in order to reach the side of the bed One in which i failed at numerous times meaning i had one sore head in the morning To make things better there is a smoke alarm placed in every room understandably However it lets you know via a bright green light that fills the tiny box room every 5 seconds leaving you with no hope of a peaceful sleep ,-0.2278

11150,Le G n ral H tel, Even though this is Paris the room was pretty small Fortunately the good sized bathroom and natural light made up for this HOWEVER the water pressure was really poor this is a 4 star hotel so being on the 6th floor shouldn t make this an issue On checking out my husband asked for a 2nd bill for his work and the service and response was unpleasant I was sitting to one side and saw the eye rolling and dirt looks that went on behind my husband s back This is unacceptable He was informed it would take 30 minutes to complete this procedure If there is an issue with doing this for paying clients than I suggest that the hotel management re access its software or billing processes Not a very pleasant way to end our stay ,-0.8132
11151,Le G n ral H tel, Even though it has undergone a relatively recent renovation the bathroom is already looking a little worn We were in a privilege room room 10 and the tiles in the shower were bulging and warped in places Room 10 also suffers from noise transfer from what I can only imagine is the ground floor I don t know if it was the receptionist or bar staff but all night we could hear someone in noisy shoes walking up and down This went on all night through to the morning Maybe they need to invest in soft rubber heel shoes Complained in the night and the morning but very unsympathetic staff Eventually on the third night we were moved to a quieter room at the front of the hotel a much smaller room and no refund was offered for the price paid for a larger room Again soundproofing is poor as can hear traffic but preferable to clomping heels through the night If you stay here don t stay in room 10 ,-0.9232

11910,Le Burgundy Paris, What lets this hotel down is the food When we arrived at about 1 30pm and ordered a simple vegetarian pizza from the room service menu we were told that they had run out of them Afterwards when we came down to their terrace area and wanted a table we were told that all the tables had been reserved and the bar was occupied with a private party so we should go find ourselves a local caf When we ordered breakfast in the room the next morning the bowl of cereal had no spoon the basket of bread came with no plate and the cup of decaf coffee was ice cold ,-0.1779

11918,Le Burgundy Paris, Listed as a five star hotel and it s a 3 4 star at best The staff are untrained and fumble through the simplest issues The room service guy doesn t bring a pen Every time something was delivered to the room a major component was missing The restaurant staff no nothing of customer service One evening we were refused entrance because we might only order coffee even after we said we might order dessert we were refused a seat more than 75 of the tables were empty Don t waste your money or time here there are many other options ,-0.7553

11931,Le Burgundy Paris, Room on the smallish side normal for Paris and the espresso maker iron board were only upon request vs already standard in the room But these are details ,0
11932,Le Burgundy Paris, No coffee tea machine When given it did not work well and no milk TC did not have adequate English channels and most of the time it did not work giving a message of satellite issue Wifi in one of the rooms had a very poor signal and hence not effective ,-0.9163
11934,Le Burgundy Paris, Toilets are separate from bathroom and the toilet was really quite small you can put your head on the door when on the toilet ,0
11941,Le Burgundy Paris, I suppose to be expected from a 5 establishment but extras are quite pricey so we didnt spend as much time in the hotel as we might otherwise have done Breakfast 35Eur each not included decided to pick up croissants and coffee at local shops for a fraction of the price beer 12 Eur at the bar facial 150 Eur for the hour ,0
11942,Le Burgundy Paris, The spa was small ,0
11944,Le Burgundy Paris, Staff did not know about our reservation ,0
11946,Le Burgundy Paris, I booked this hotel in advance and paid in advance as a special treat for the New Year s Eve period for my wife who has recently recovered from cancer Post the terrorism events in Paris and the heightened security concerns across Europe me and my wife decided to change our plans and not travel to Europe during this period We contacted the hotel and presented our case yet was told that we will not be granted a refund for the 1600 that we paid for two nights because they said as far as they are concern life goes on and their are no security concerns in Paris We was very offended and the hotel made no efforts to assist us and stuck to their policy despite this being a peak period and they could very easily have rebooked our rooms Now we have two night paid and we have lost our money For such a prestigious hotel I am deeply upset at how they have treated us We spent along time to choose the right hotel and paid a premium and now we have lost everything ,-0.9357
11947,Le Burgundy Paris, No breakfast included with booking made online We paid for our breakfast but I think there should have been a bigger selection for the buffet considering the price paid I felt our junior suite was a bit too cozy as I was expecting a more spacious room The Baudelaire did not live up to our expectations but possibly because there was a large function at the hotel so our food was compromised The staff also looked very busy ,-0.1531
11948,Le Burgundy Paris, All in all the negatives were down to the timing of our visit Building site right next door and so very noisy early morning There was filming going on during the day which interfered with customer access so not exactly customer focused Maybe a bit of planning to avoid key times in the day would have been sensible Concierge services could be a bit more proactive Mini bar should have had wine in it not just a small sparkling wine ,-0.0932
11951,Le Burgundy Paris, Front desk and concierge staff were not prepared as you expected in a 5 stars hotel with the exception of concierge Samuel Doormen never did their work Horrible and intense air freshener in the lobby,-0.5812
11952,Le Burgundy Paris, There was only one mirror and that was in the bathroom It was only on our last day that we discovered there was an electrical outlet by the radiator for drying hair in front of the mirror We also discovered that there was a full length mirror inside the wardrobe ,0
11954,Le Burgundy Paris, I grew to dislike the perfumed aroma in the public areas of the hotel ,-0.3818
11956,Le Burgundy Paris, Restaurant was closed at time of visit and limited areas to sit for coffee etc bar was quite dark for daytime which was where we had to use during our visit at breakfast and for coffee,-0.2263
11957,Le Burgundy Paris, the only drawback is a breakfast it is very good but not as amazing as in George V or others equivalent ones while it is still quite expensive They should decrease price or increase quolity mean variety ,-0.0159
11958,Le Burgundy Paris, We have stayed here before and enjoyed our stay however in this occasion there were noisy deliveries and building works through the night The staff neglected to inform us of swimming pool closure throughout our stay and the did not even have the common courtesy to offer any kind of rate reduction Staff are dishonest and it is a shame but I will not stay there again A little apology and a discount would have sufficed ,-0.4921
11959,Le Burgundy Paris, This is the second time I lived in this hotel I feel very disappointed The laundry service was not good I require a dry clean for my blouse After the dry clean the odour is still remain on the blouse So I need to send it to another dry clean store again The room service guy is unprofessional For example I ordered a cherry ice cream last night This morning I want to order cherry ice cream again I have been told they was no cherry flavor only strawberry After a long time check they acknowledge that they did have cherry flavor So I ordered two scoopes In the later evening I want to order another two scoopes cherry ice cream I had been told that they do not do two scoopes only four scoopes Terrible room service,-0.6907

12111,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room was tiny well laid out for fitting everything in but basically you could hop on the bed or into the bathroom pod and that s about it It wasn t cleaned properly and you couldn t open the door to the bathroom pod without it hitting the toilet and making a massive clang The iPad set up for the room was cool but it ran out of battery as we didn t put it back on the charger correctly our fault I know but it s a huge design flaw if the iPad is dead you can t do anything ,-0.6187

12125,citizenM London Shoreditch, rooms was not as clean as we would have liked and as a tall person the bed jammed in the end of the room is not super comfortable with 2 people lift system was frustrating and not working to the point that we ended up taking the stairs on a few occasions music in the reception area too loud ,-0.8023
12127,citizenM London Shoreditch, However there was one huge thing missing for me and that was tea and coffee making facilities Part of enjoying a break away for me is making a morning coffee in the room and snuggling back in bed with news channel on Instead I had to get up get dressed and go down in the lift to the canteen in reception pay a fiver for a tea and coffee and take them back to the room which rather defeated the object If we stay there again which we probably will I will take my own travel kettle and coffee supplies ,0
12133,citizenM London Shoreditch, The canteen was not very good at midnight when I wanted something to eat ,-0.3865
12139,citizenM London Shoreditch, The sink is not inside the bathroom and this is a bit uncomfortable I had to pay a 29 surcharge for the early check out 3 30 am this is unacceptable after paying the room for that night Be careful ,-0.6597

12142,citizenM London Shoreditch, The windows don t open so there was no fresh air in the room The bathroom smelled really musty and of drains which was quite unpleasant Also it wasn t super clean there was a layer of dust on the shelves and the hairdryer bag under the sink The tv channels were really random all German and Spanish channels And they don t do 24 hour room service as advertised Overall it suited our needs and was the perfect location for us but little things let it down which was a shame ,-0.2607

12163,citizenM London Shoreditch, No parking always sucks Not being able to turn the aircon off gives me a headache and disturbed sleep ,-0.743
12166,citizenM London Shoreditch, The only potential uncomfortable thing is the bathroom which is only some sort of capsule with very thin walls and barely isolated and sound proofed So if you travel with someone and you are not at very high intimacy levels using the bathroom may be a bit strange ,-0.6605
12167,citizenM London Shoreditch, The room is very compact but the large window means it doesn t feel too cramped ,0
12173,citizenM London Shoreditch, Lack of coffee I read that as there was no kettles coffee was available for free It turned out we had to pay for it which was a shame ,-0.5719

12179,citizenM London Shoreditch, They could do with more lifts so get a lower floor so you can use the stairs Not close to parks if you want to run ,-0.2878
12182,citizenM London Shoreditch, The air conditioning failed to maintain a constant room temperate Even on the lowest temperature setting it would not cool the room during the night time ,-0.7822
12186,citizenM London Shoreditch, Booking com say you can pay cash although this isn t an option at the hotel,-0.1027
12187,citizenM London Shoreditch, Only negative thing We stayed for 3 nights After the 1st night we did not leave our towels on the floor meaning we want to use them again They were replaced After the 2nd night I explicitly wrote a note to the housekeeper saying that we would be fine with the same towels and would not need new ones for just one more night They were replaced again It might me meant well but I think it was a waste and ecological non sense to exchange towels 3 days in a row shower floor hands 5 towels each day ,-0.5962
12188,citizenM London Shoreditch, Absolutely nothing ,0

12195,citizenM London Shoreditch, No tea or coffee in room ,-0.296
12197,citizenM London Shoreditch, To me the hotel is basically an easyHotel dressed up in hipster clothes to justify an exorbitant price tag An iPad mini installed with a few gimmicky controls to change the colour of the light bulbs does little to make up for the cramped room and lack of the basics like a mini bar with a few refreshments or even I dunno tea and coffee facilities Sorry I expected a little more for my money ,-0.0258

13675,Maison Borella, We had an early flight to catch so needed to leave at 8am when breakfast begins at the weekend Therefore we asked the receptionist if we could arrange something to take away or have a little earlier We appreciated this was an exception and were only hoping for maybe a couple of croissants or other breakfast items if the croissants weren t ready coffee and juice We spoke to the receptionist more than once to confirm this and arrange that we would come down at 7 30am and sit in the lounge area to take breakfast rather than in the breakfast room Unfortunately we were greeted with breakfast staff who did not know about these arrangements and told us breakfast was not open a few times After some debate they huffily conceded to fetch us some breakfast items The ridiculous thing was that the breakfast was already laid out like a bountiful banquet of pastries etc and we could see it through the glass doors but they wouldn t let us in there to pick a couple of things Instead we had to awkwardly point through the glass whilst they picked things out They brought us out some drinks but then we had to send them back for milk and they brought us yoghurts without spoons The man was clearly cross about this taking up his time when he was supposed to be setting up breakfast so I don t know why he didn t just let us serve ourselves This was a really stressful start to the day and a disappointing end to the stay at this hotel We were on a tight timescale to leave for the airport so having our time wasted by waiting for someone to bring us things when they weren t prepared was really annoying ,-0.9376

13804,Ohla Eixample, doors are so thin you can t sleep in morning due to cleaners being so loud with their talkie walkies and making too much noise cleaning with hover and such but the worst was their talkie walkie set up on like car volume level,-0.5267
13805,Ohla Eixample, Breakfast was a disappointment WE often stay at Hospes Hotels in Spain and their breakfast is far superior You have no smoked salmon for instance fruit was sparce just not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel Some of the modern furniture looked a bit cheap ,-0.25

13822,Ohla Eixample, I booked a table in advance at the guest relation for the two of us in the restaurant of the hotel and asked for a five course vegetarian menu which was confirmed At arrival we checked in and went almost straight to have dinner Nobody seemed to know anything about our reservation and definatly not about the vegetarian whish We were told that it s not possible to have a 4 5 course Veggie Menu in that restaurant so we left Not a real good start in that hotel and a bit of a shame for the restaurant crew There was just 1 other table so they would have had the time to be creative if they wanted to The breakfast was good but the crew always seemed to be kind of scared of the breakfast Boss They were no able to take choices by us they allways had to ask him which produced a kind of nervous atmosphere ,-0.8667

14969,The Dylan Amsterdam, I booked a double room in this 5 star hotel as a treat to my wife We were then shunted to The New Annex to a room that could have featured in any 3 4 star hotel chain It had a pokey stairwell and looked dreadful When I enquiried about availability of other rooms it was obvious that 400 per night did not buy me a room in the main hotel During my three day stay not one member of management spoke to me On check out I notice an item on my bill for 9 euros this I found out was for having bacon with my breakfast which was included in my rate This hotel really needs to decide what it wants to be To charge 400 for the room I had is immoral,-0.4939

15638,De L Europe Amsterdam, Whether this was a fluke and despite the fact that they gave me some credit This experience should not be generalized due to some exceptional people like the manager I dealt with Jonathan from front and Dionne from room service The credit is justified and I have to write the review and share my experience The credit is not meant to keep the story untold Except for the flooding which was caused by another guest that left their shower on then created the leak to my room there are other aspects that are very poor The leak was excusable it was not caused by the hotels condition The leak happened on our last day That disaster was the icing on the cake Still the leak on my shoes and fox fur jacket wet I never got to wear it The manager offered to help but after repeated issues I couldn t trust the service My problem with this hotel is its poor service by the select few lack of attention to details and subpar in room food dining My first day Front desk offered to place dinner reservations at a restaurant that I had looked forward to going I wish I never had accepted their assistance It was meant to be for a date 2 days from my arrival The same night I received a letter confirming the dinner was made on a different day hence I lost my place and had to go somewhere else It was a good place but was not my choice Also on the same night of arrival I set up a cake to be delivered on a certain day This cake was delivered on the wrong day which ruined my surprise I also asked for an I room massage which at first was confirmed on a different day and had I not caught on I wouldn t have been able to correct it So the massage appt was done right but only because I caught the mistake beforehand On top of this the front kept calling my room to inform us of the cake and dinner reservations concierge knew it was a surprise so basically they blew the surprise by talking to the birthday celebrant ,-0.6073

17069,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The service is fine but not great for a 5 star hotel The hotel is made of several townhouses that were merged into this quaint yet fancy hotel Some rooms are located in between floors which means you may have to go up and down some stairs to reach yours Considering this in a 5 star accomodation I would expect to have a bellman to carry my heavy luggage and not have to do it myself The bathroom is not equiped with a bath only a shower The breakfast was a disappointment to us and so was the bar ,-0.8534

19911,Hotel Esther a, Staff were not as good at providing suggestions as we would have expected,-0.3412
19918,The Stafford London, we were booked in a standard room wanted a larger room and were willing to pay as well they upgraded us to a junior suite as no other larger room was available for more than 100 GBP to our utter shock we realised that the so called junior suite was located outside the main building on ground floor the junior suite had connectivity issues and no network was available we complained about it as well the duty manager offered to change the room as soon as she could get one but we were not keen to stay in 3 different rooms for 3 nights the duty manager then agreed to waive off the upgrade charges when i asked her to consider our plight she gave a further discount on our stay ,-0.6967
19919,The Stafford London, Staff really not that friendly or attentive to details nothing like the fabulous staff at the Wellesley Drinks offer as mentioned above only included soft drinks Also worth noting that I was aware the hotel had lots of empty rooms the night we stayed Seems a shame for the staff not to offer a room upgrade even for a small fee ,-0.8682
19924,The Stafford London, Aside from the size of the room nothing ,0
19927,The Stafford London, Breakfast is served in two adjoining areas If you are unfortunate you will be given a table in the rear part as we were which has no natural light and is a gloomy place to start the day ,-0.6917

19931,The Stafford London, Room was very small and filled with too much furniture items Not enough room for two people and luggage ,0

19934,The Stafford London, There was no mirror near a plug so you could dry and style your hair There is no lighted make up mirror in the bathroom ,-0.5267
19938,The Stafford London, The property is very nicely maintained but tired Regarding the room part of the view was a tile wall across an alley We had what was billed as an upgraded king room which was so small that it did not have room to place a suitcase on a rack It was difficult to get from the far side of the bed to the door bathroom There was only one useable drawer The tub was elevated and doubled as shower It was dangerously difficult to stand in it The finishes were dated and for example the lamps were just plain cheap I do not think that the hotel qualifies as five star based on the rooms ,-0.9225
19942,The Stafford London, The food was good not great breakfast quite expensive and nothing special ,-0.3923
19943,The Stafford London, The room was a little tight really The bathroom really needs a do over mouldy grouting mastic For a place that costs around 280 per night should be better maintained Main gripe would be the breakfast 31 for the breakfast is pretty steep I d say Yes you can have fruit croissants and fry up fish eggs florentine etc but really how much can you eat for 31 The cherry on the top of the 31 was the 2x service charges that they pop onto the bill at the end which you can red facedly ask them to take off but lets face it not many would One charge at 13 per day and another at around 7 per day Bringing the daily cost of breakfast to 82 for 2 people which I think is rather galling Shame As the 31 was enough to bare to begin with ,-0.1779

19953,The Stafford London, Some staff incl receptionist and restaurant manager had such poor understanding of English that significant mistakes were made Why was room equipped with only coffee making facilities and we had to ask for tea making facilities Expensive for what we had not helped by hidden service charge of over 10 in bar Plumbing noises far too audible at night,-0.5859
19955,The Stafford London, For over 1000 per night I would have expected better service I ordered a pot of tea to be delivered to the lounge area which I had been told was available and no one seemed to know how to accomplish that After 20 minutes it still hadn t arrived When I asked about it it was obvious that the order had been lost and it was another 10 minutes for it to arrive There was no outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer They had special plugs for electric razors but the hair dryer furnished by the hotel couldn t be plugged in I had to use it in the bedroom which was disruptive to family members who were still trying to sleep A light bulb was out in the bathroom and no one noticed for a couple of days Even with all light bulbs burning the lighting in the bathroom was terrible It was so dark it was difficult to put on makeup There was a New Year s Eve event in the restaurant which overflowed into the lounge area for hotel guests We came back to relax for a while between dinner and fireworks and had to sit it our room for over 2 hours since we couldn t use the hotel s public spaces This is my fourth trip to London and I will be returning to the hotel I have stayed in before Won t be back ,-0.34
19956,The Stafford London, Stayed in a mews suite there was no mobile phone reception and there was construction work and people creating noise ,0
19957,The Stafford London, Probably overpriced despite upgrade to king size bed Only two Nespresso capsules provided and although others could be brought to the room this was not convenient early in the morning No hairdryer in room Shower was reasonably small for such a starred hotel Not 8 rating for the price range and location ,-0.296
19958,The Stafford London, There is are 2 large tables just outside the dining area between the 2 fireplaces that are used for breakfast and large families The chairs are way too low for the tables We saw other guests also ask for extra cushions to prop themselves up higher ,-0.2732
19959,The Stafford London, Restaurant staff sometimes did not listen to our food requirements particularly at breakfast The Xmas Eve Dinner did not represent value for money whilst prepared and cooked well it was disappointing in that it was quite average,-0.304

19962,The Stafford London, Not really a dislike more an observation the payment of 340 was taken or held overnight Friday although booked as pay on arrival This could have caused problems if I hadn t checked before we left home,-0.1803
19965,The Stafford London, The choice of whole meal bread used for both toast and the bacon sandwich that I ordered for breakfast were dreadful some awful cheap sunblest entirely tasteless Not at all what I would expect in a good restaurant ,-0.4588
19966,The Stafford London, Room could have used an update Breakfast was inordinately expensive I was charged 5 50 for toast in British pounds when I had ordered eggs a la carte eggs tea and toast 28 pounds no juice no extras plus gratuity I am used to 5 star hotels but I felt thjis was out of range,-0.1421

19976,The Stafford London, Bad air conditioning Bad only one elevator Whole day Maintenance Bad location Service room close by guest rooms You hear the door open and close most of the day The hotel will try to find any reason to charge your credit card ,-0.836
19977,The Stafford London, 1 The location is not easy to find 2 Its quite noisy at night because of the bar 3 The hotel charged me unbelievable phone bill They said I made a phone call to Brazil I think one of a cleaner used the phone ,-0.4017
19978,The Stafford London, The bed was way too soft I woke up with a sore back The air conditioning was loud Apart from that there s nothing else to say ,-0.3612
19979,The Stafford London, The wifi service was terrible with receptionist asking for firewall to be removed on the computer before a wifi service could be provided The breakfast chefs were very poor to the point of being ridiculous for being a 5 star Hotel Kippers served in a big pile 40 min after request the next day traditional English breakfast served 2 min after request very poorly cooked Sunny side up eggs were baked scrambled eggs were runny to be point of being half cooked In essence this hotel wins on style but loses out completely on detail Not a 5 star proposition at all,-0.5521

19988,The Stafford London, Hotel needs a more thorough overhaul to look feel more up to date starting with the hotel entrance Main door to room needs serious isolation as all is heard to the minutest detail from the corridor and presumable vice versa Indiscrete Get rid of the shower curtains unfathomable that they are still in use Simply unhygienic Otherwise good bathroom ,-0.0258

23394,La Villa Haussmann, the room it s self was very small not enough room to even change I choose the room based on size I thought it was suppose to be a special weekend and our room was way smaller then it appeared in the photos I also wanted a bath tub and the way the bathtub was set up if was hard for me and my partner to get in I paid a lot of money for this room and we couldn t really move the pool was nice but the curtain hanging in there were very dirty and had a radish Brown stain on about half of them we really didn t want to touch the sides ,-0.2249

27677,Catalonia Catedral, Location of our room apparently my fault because I asked for a view I got solar panels half the pool railings and rooftops at the back of the hotel all from a window no Juliet balcony as shown in the room photos We could not open the curtains fully as people using the pool could see directly in A totally CLEAR glass bathroom toilet door What s that all about We were offered to move next day but decided not to bother That was before the lift kept going nuts Room 501 next to the lift first morning the lift door was repeatedly opening and closing itself and banging at 5am and then again at 6 20am I had to phone reception both times because they could not hear it Trust me we could Continually inconsistent servicing of room water one night no water next night no milk I don t expect this at 4 star level Paid more than expected probably due to Euro In fairness staff kept apologising and gave us complementary breakfast In truth I would rather all had been well ,-0.584

27689,Catalonia Catedral, The rooms are a bit dark the hotel was constructed in an ancient cathedral and the window opens on the interior of the hotel with a glass elevator at the center So you cannot really open your window without having pretty much every other room clients and elevator users watching you They vaporized too much perfume in the lobby and the smell was too strong and unpleasant The deco of the rooms is too sober black and grey which is a bit depressing especially given that the natural light does not enter the rooms especially those located in the first floor ,-0.3022

29780,Alma Barcelona GL, Unfortunately when we were there the rooftop bar was closed as it only opens in summer Not sure why as weather in Barcelona allows to stay outside already in May when we were there There was a private party in the garden on our first night with loud music until midnight that we couldn t avoid even in the bedroom Finally there was no door to the bathroom and when we asked whether there was another room available with a door to the bathroom we were told that this was only available for luxury superior rooms It seems odd that this is a luxury in this category of hotel ,-0.4333

29979,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Both early mornings we were rudely woken up by very heavy hammering which sounded like builders knocking out bathroom floor tiles in the room above us which really disturbed our rest but the biggest disappointment was that the hotel staff denied that any building work was ongoing in the hotel whilst outside a builder and plumber van were parked We paid 600 for each night for a suite overlooking the canal the heavy noise spoilt our stay,-0.8909
29980,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The manager promised to change the room for us after the room was flooded and soaking wet with rainstorm They offered us a bottle of coke and beer with some bowls of nuts instead I had to stay in that room for 3 nights and the worse thing appeared on the third night The air conditioning broke down The housekeeping came up to my room and promise to fix it but unsucessfully At 11pm we had to call the hotel security to check and fix it We didn t want to make our stay turning ugly so we simply let it be Anyway that was the last night of our stay at this hotel and probably we will never return ,-0.4767

30117,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, one suggestion we have would be in regards to breakfast We thought we would try breakfast at the hotel on our first morning in Barcelona Sadly we were a little let down as the food did not impress Small variety on the menu and after ordering our hot meal which arrived after 20 min it was not a hot meal at all we were left with over cooked eggs and bland tasting food for 22 Euros per person it was not worth it at all we sadly didn t return to breakfast However this would not determine the fact of if we would return on not as we most definitely will Can not thank the staff enough for their professionalism and willlingness to help ,-0.6235

30126,H10 Port Vell 4 Sup, I disappointed that the not inexpensive cost of a room did not include the price of breakfast which was available at an extra cost of 23 Euros The general decor of the hotel was very dated including the drab carpeting This did not warrant the relatively high cost of the hotel I booked the hotel after searching for hotels in Barcelona with a swimming pool The small plunge pool on the roof stretched this definition somewhat ,-0.4767

33568,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Our room was right next to the elevator I could hear it going up and down with people chatting all night I didn t sleep In addition there is an automatic fluorescent light in the bathroom that can not be turned off So the bathroom door must be kept closed since any tiny bit of movement will turn the light on Even rolling over in your bed turns this obnoxious light on ,-0.5423
33570,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, My girlfriend and I had requested a twin bed and the hotel confirmed we were getting one before we arrived Once there they gave us a room with a queed bed and a little bed in the hall at the entrance of the room The bed was clearly designed for a couple traveling with a child When lying on the bed are legs did not fit in the bed We complained to the manager and the owner and both insisted we got what we had requested We found out from another employee that in fact they had rooms with twin beds but ours was given to someone else The owner was rude and not accepting of their error The rooms are expensive and you would expect a better approach with dealing with customer dissatisfaction ,-0.9264

38627,Hotel Cafe Royal, No clear distinction of the hotel on the street If you re not familiar with the streets buildings of London you could easily walk past the hotel and not take notice of it Walls floors and room doors are not sound proof I would ve much rather been disturbed by the noise in the streets than from guest neighbors and hotel staff Easily hear housekeeping and other staff talking walking Frustrating For a five star hotel one would expect sound proof doors at least Though the hotel is relatively new the eclectic themed rooms are way outdated most of the room features such as lighting A C and curtains are controlled electronically and sometimes they didn t work properly ,-0.4374

38640,Hotel Cafe Royal, It all start with the reception desk basically nobody smiles The general state of mind is to continuously explain why you can get this or that The problem are all yours and you are bothering them Then you get to your room where many things are out of services including the shower that gives either burning hot water or ice cold noway to find a midway The BF is simply absurd you either have a la carte choice next to the reception or a la carte choice in the caf There they would server food first and then 15min later toast that goes with it The idea that they could come together is apparently not yet on there agenda The kids had a very small access window to the swimming pool more or else 1 hour in the morning and one in the afternoon But keep in mind they aren t really welcome in this place and you get the message very clearly from the staff When you see staff anyway in the corridors they wait for your to say Hello otherwise they just stare at you The food is very medium level for this kind of hotel The concierge is totally lost you can ask for your car or anything he always has to check what Good question But the bottom line is that you have to wait no way to get something in a reasonable time Very very disappointing stay way too expensive for the service TO BE AVOIDED ,-0.595

39307,Olivia Balmes Hotel, I was so looking forward to my five days at the hotel and there were some things that were truly great but it s always those annoying things that ruin a travel experience and for me they piled up a little too much at the Olivia Balmes Readers will have to judge for themselves whether any of these are a deal killer 1 Before I arrived I had several back and forth emails trying to get an answer regarding my booking and payment Was very frustrated with a few days to go before I left not having my urgent requests answered Just ignored my emails In the end I just chanced it that the booking was confirmed and it was 2 One day the lock did not activate and for hours my door was just not locked Door was shut but when I arrived back I just pushed it open and realized it had not locked Hotel did check it and it worked Nothing was taken 3 I love to swim and when I say the photo of the pool I thought it was a huge wonderful rooftop pool It was the main reason I booked It s actually not a pool for real swimming The lens distorts the size and it s actually a very very small barely lap pool not the one you see in the photos 4 If you don t like to hear your neighbors well the walls are quite thin in my opinion My neighbors came in late and when they lay on their bed it banged loudly against the shared wall You hear a lot in the corridor 5 One last thing They change the wifi password every day and you need to collect the new one from reception each morning Became a real frustration ,-0.7599

41570,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Just one issue The building is of course old This means that the heating cooling system is limited our room was really warm and we couldn t cool it Turns out the A C was essentially switched to heat mode according to the front desk as it had been cooler in the city prior to our arrival We had to sleep with the windows open as the room wouldn t cool and on the first floor we were exposed to street noise and worse cigarette smoke from the sidewalk below Not good when your wife has a lung disease ,-0.2294

43348,The Langham London, Slight issues first my mini bar had a half opened box of nuts in it from previous occupant Room decor was a bit too neutral for me Lastly only BBC seemed to be working on the television I however did not report any of this and am sure the Langham team would have done everything to accommodate me ,0

43360,The Langham London, Very disappointed that we did not receive an email to let us know that the spa facilities were not working due to renovation before our stay We booked here due to its location and the spa for a relaxing weekend only to be told on check on that it was shut ,-0.0498
43364,The Langham London, Was not able to book a table for breakfast at a specific time Needed to walk in which for a table of six meant a wait ,0
43367,The Langham London, That we couldn t stay longer ,0
43370,The Langham London, For over 1000 pounds per 2 nights we had 2 twin beds with a small chair jammed in a corner The view was of the brick building 10 feet away This was the only choice and we grabbed it Big mistake Never ever staying here again I tried to cancel an hour later well before the 24 hour checkin and you were going to charge for one night stay That was wrong Next time I will use another service ,-0.6597
43372,The Langham London, Spa was constantly booked no effort made to offer alternative times shorter treatments to accommodate us as guests or genius guests ,-0.296

43387,The Langham London, Nothing,0
43389,The Langham London, My only criticism would be the need for a mirror to be located near to a table and plug and at a height that can be used when sitting down to dry hair etc This was the only down side and did prove quite inconvenient,-0.6801
43391,The Langham London, This hotel should not be rated as wheelchair accessible The entrance is not wheelchair accessible except through their excess ability lift which was broken upon our arrival This made our stay very uncomfortable as we had to travel in and out of the hotel through the spa which is also not very wheelchair friendly with the step at the main door and two steps to get you into the building The wheelchair ramp at the spa is too narrow to fit my mothers wheelchair which is wider than average What makes things more complicated is that the spa closes at 9 PM and if you intend to stay out later than that the hotel personal had to take us through the back doors of the loading area of the hotel into our bedroom which was a very unpleasant experience Even to get to the spa we had to travel from our floor to the ground floor take another lift to the first floor through long corridoors and then another lift and then go all the way at the other end of the building and finally into the spa It truly was like a maze Very ridiculous to spend about 15 minutes every time we wanted to leave or enter the hotel Moreover to go to breakfast at the club lounge we had to travel from our bedroom to the lobby at the ground floor and take a service elevator to the club lounge So the clubroom that is wheelchair accessible has no accessibility to the club lounge because it has a few steps at the entrance We checked out the next day Was not worth the daily struggle In my opinion the hotel should ve given us a courtesy call to inform us about the broken lift and gave us a choice to change our reservation to a more accessible hotel They also should have offered to deliver breakfast to the bedroom every day instead of us traveling to different elevators every day to get to the club lounge Finally beds are too high for a disabled person Can t get in or out without assisstance ,-0.8929
43392,The Langham London, Room was a little small for a twin but not unusually so for a London hotel ,0
43395,The Langham London, People smoking on my floor It filtered into my room and woke me up during the night several times If the hotel knows this is an issue they need to address it and smoke alarms should be in every room to prevent this If someone smoking caused a fire it would be disastrous ,-0.8074

43432,The Langham London, Room temperature is hard to control a bit cold Water temperature is difficult to control either fairly hot or fairly cold The breakfast menu did not include every offering they have you will need to ask the staff for the extra offerings Sometimes for a small service you get many staff members helping which makes it difficult to tip the right amount to the right people ,-0.4939

43466,The Langham London, I booked a grand twin room whose size was recorded as 28 square meters In fact the room looked very small and the size was like 20 square meters Maybe a structure problem or anything else I asked a high floor with nice view at reservation with 3 nights but found the assignment in a completely opposite way It was totally out of my expectation with a high price room reservation The room also had a shower drain problem I do not recommend a grand twin room at least for a family ,-0.7674

43872,The Ned, I probably needed more guidance on the different restaurants and types of food as they all looked quite similar and on the evening of arrival were very busy hence the reason why i chose the rooftop restaurant,0
43873,The Ned, Staff should offer better orientation introduction on arrival explaining all food and Bev outlets that guests can access and also that they are not allowed to bring guests to which would avoid embarrassment ,-0.296
43875,The Ned, restaurant food not at the same standard as the hotel work needed Italian restaurant on flavour Wine list also expensive for very average wine,0
43877,The Ned, Rooms giving on to the atrium are extremely noisy owing to the restaurants on the ground floor and the absence of sufficient insulation for the windows This is a very significant problem In the meantime ask for a room on the outside of he hotel one that doesn t give on to the atrium I would also say that the hotel has yet to reconcile what it wants to be and what it s priorities are Hotel reception was brilliant accommodating to a fault welcoming friendly efficient But the hotel is also a private club and has several independently operated restaurants and bars that are not nearly as interested in prioritizing service for hotel guests On multiple occasions we were made to feel distinctly unwelcome in the restaurants and bars since we were merely hotel guests and not club members That is somewhat odd particularly since over my short stay I paid nearly half as much as a club member would pay in dues for an entire year I hope these are simply growing pains but I fear they might be a feature by design ,-0.8437
43881,The Ned, noisy room limited shelf wardrobe space no luggage rack scratched my hand on the doorknob no shower by pool sauna water station and towels at gym not adequate ,-0.5371
43884,The Ned, A very minor issue I couldn t get the Coffee maker in my room to work ,0
43887,The Ned, Went to rooftop pool and the young guy at the desk had a poor attitude asked us to bring our room cardholder to access the rooftop area as if I d done something wrong despite the fact I showed I had my room key and given my name which was checked against a list More his individual attitude manner that was not befitting of a 5 star hotel Had to open the door for ourselves with suitcases on the way out whilst 2 staff members inside the hotel who were not clearly identifiable as were not wearing uniforms stood and chatted Would never have happened at Shangri La where we stayed the next night Other members of staff however were very pleasant seems to be luck of the draw whoever you interact with Minor issues above which did not detract from overall quality of stay but you would expect not to happen in a 5 star hotel ,-0.111
43891,The Ned, Nothing ,0
43892,The Ned, bathroom really needs brighter lighting a close up mirror a second hook for towels You need to do something with the dead corner in the bathroom maybe a seat full length mirror ,-0.3446
43894,The Ned, The room was very noise and could not open the window at night for security reasons so for people like me who like a bit of fresh air at night this was problematic Till 1 am when I had to call the reception you could hear an on going subtle noise of music bum bum they said the had music all over the night and eventually turned the volume down There was an empty bottle under the bed when I got in and where disappointed when I found out that the cosy rooms had no bath though on the sites it says Room facilities Air conditioning Iron Desk Ironing Facilities Heating Wardrobe Closet Cleaning products Clothes rack Shower Hairdryer Bathrobe Toilet Bathroom Bath or Shower ,-0.0094
43895,The Ned, Nothing,0

43901,The Ned, View from room was just across an 8 foot lighting shaft to other rooms Lifts so dark you couldn t see the floor numbers on the panel Electronic door keys were hard to work until you got the knack confirmed by other guests Very little hanging drawer space anywhere No hooks for towels etc in the bathroom They ve only been open 2 months so give them a chance to sort out these teething probs,-0.1531

43916,The Ned, As I mentioned above the room was a tad dark,0
43920,The Ned, My room was small for what I consider medium Also straight in front of the bed was an odd 6ft panel that could have easily been addressed with a tapestry or some other creative solution It looked like an ironing board door but not properly finished There was also a large leak discoloration on the ceiling Room 446 When I was checking out unfortunately their was an enormous ceiling leak in the lobby ,-0.6925
43921,The Ned, Absolutely nothing ,0

43929,The Ned, Poor noise insulation Staff started hoovering very loudly at 3 45a m Meaning that i used ear plugs for first time in my life Also a shame that the Hamman room was not yet open and was still being constructed ,-0.7351

43942,The Ned, Nothing of significant,-0.1511
43943,The Ned, We felt the level of service in the bar restaurant was very poor we were also asked to wait 30 40 mins to be able to have a drink in the vault even though it was half empty We were also told that we couldn t have dinner on the roof as we weren t members and because there were 5 of us looking to eat we were told if we were members they could accommodate us or if there was only 4 eating Such a stupid thing to say to guests even if that was the rule We probably wouldn t return to this hotel in the future ,-0.8221
43946,The Ned, The A C didn t work in our room and we had a very uncomfortable night as it was a very hot day There were no bath towels provided discovered after I got in the shower Small annoyances like no hooks in the bathroom cheap acrylic instead of cotton robes The greeter and server at breakfast were a bit snotty and not welcoming The breakfast itself was probably the worst eggs benedict I ve ever had Compared to the breakfast at other luxury hotels in London it was a joke Much of this could be attributed to the hotel being newly opened and all the bugs not worked out ,-0.8979
43947,The Ned, Popcorn in mini bar costs 8 Was only allowed to take one guest into hotel s members facilities and had two visitors made me feel not welcome,-0.357

43966,The Ned, No disabled access to either pools very poor considering it is a spa hotel and meant my mum could not enjoy either pools The hot water did not work in the room they kindly upgraded us to another room however we could not gain access to the room untill16 30 having arrived at the hotel at 12 00 The wrong cases were delivered to our room I tried to contact concierge but the telephone did not work and to top it all they even tried to charge us for a complimentary pressubg service so all in all not a great experience for a 250 a night 5 star hotel ,-0.5913
43968,The Ned, The room service menu is the worst I ve seen in a hotel of this category This is especially bizarre given that they have a whole bunch of restaurants downstairs ,-0.7713
43971,The Ned, Stepping out of the lift to an unfinished area and strong smell of recently plastered walls Cooking smells from the nearby kitchens if windows in the bedroom were open and also coming in via an air vents meant the windows had to be kept closed and air con kept on continually The phone was faulty so we had to use mobile phones to contact reception or go downstairs to reception in person the problem was reported at 3pm but was never resolved The TV did not work on arrival the problem was reported at 3pm and was not dealt with until after we had gone out for the evening The fridge had not been plugged in and it was impossible to move the fridge to locate the sockets that were somewhere behind a panel with circular hole cut in to it As the fridge had not been plugged in the milk inside had gone off The fridge problem was not resolved though we were supplied with fresh milk for an end of day hot drink and a pot of coffee for one was delivered the following morning At no point were we offered a change of room When we checked out the following morning our modest cost of bar drinks and snacks was waived by way of compensation ,-0.9101
