Hotel Cavendish, The bed was slightly hard for my tastes but I could still sleep on it The breakfast room is quite compact and there was people having to wait for tables at some times on the morning 
Hotel Cavendish, This property was not up to any standards Pillows were so old and should have been replaced long ago The tap on the bathroom sink barely ran water The room was supposed to be for three people and there was literally no room for luggage We had to open one case at a time as there was no room for us to manage all three pieces of luggage The chair opened up to a bed which was so uncomfortable that my grandson had the worst sleeps in the 21 days we were travelling When I went to pay I was told that my credit card had already been charged No where in the eight hotels I had booked for our trip did the hotel charge my credit card without telling me I would not recommend this hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was the tiniest I have ever seen If fitted a comfortable bed barely That s it this is an accurate description of the room 
Hotel Cavendish, The windows didn t close properly and the room wasn t thoroughly clean rubbish was left under the beds Breakfast was ok but basic 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was in basement accessed through breakfast room next to kitchen so very noisy View from window was of small dirty broken courtyard pillows so flat may as well not had one Whole place needs an upgrade basement room should be sold as such at reduced rate Luckly only staying one night
Hotel Cavendish, Booked this room for just myself single room and it was ridiculously small There are no photos of the single rooms so I didn t know what I was getting into Very overpriced for what I got 100 contemplated moving hotel however no point in wasting all that money Pretty disappointed but oh well 
Hotel Cavendish, Very old building staff not having a clue about how to serve customers carpet cleanliness was apalling Doors furnitures bathroom were properly dirty The reception desk staff was robotic and made us unconfortable at the check in They are not interested in give a good impression to customers because the location is central and they can trap a lot of tourists The quality of the breakfast was poor and the table wasn t even completed with pots and cutleries Members of staff in the breakfast room were rude and not helping Outside of the window of the breakfast room there was a gas station with NO SMOKING sign and a builder contractor was smoking at no more than a meter away Also the smell of smoking was coming inside the breakfast room I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone at 115 per night for a triple room The night before a good size rat was calmly scouting the area outside the window 
Hotel Cavendish, It might be handy to have some umbrellas to help your clientele during rainy periods Not a deal breaker but it s a nice additional help to have An extra set of pillows would have been optimal 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was not ready for us 3 sharing with the 2 singles with one quilt and the put up bed not made The room was very tight for 3 beds and they kept forgetting to provide a third cup for tea making and the equivalent supplies A mouse ran out from under the bed when they had separated the single beds It ran out under the door but we then had to check that it had not returned and put shoes along the gap under the door we did not bother to tell the management as were amused It may have come through the open window off the scaffolding as we were at the rear of the hotel and there was work being done to the old building 
Hotel Cavendish, Cooking smells and noise at 6 30 am Filthy window ledge and scaffold outside my ground level room No lock on the window Safe didn t work When I asked for hangers it was suggested I buy some myself Breakfast had no healthy options I would call it a 2 hotel NOT a 3 or 4 as it rates itself 
Hotel Cavendish, The WIFI did not work in my room at all My 16 year old son was home alone and I wanted to be sure that he d got home safely after an evening out I was unable to message him from my room so I had to get up get dressed and go down to reception three times to connect to WIFI I stayed in this hotel for two reasons location close to my meetings and the certainty of having WIFI 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was a bit dowdy The wash basin tap only had a trickle of water and the wash basin plug was inoperable breakfast facilities very basic
Hotel Cavendish, the room is not quite clean dust cobweb on the floor not suitable for travelers with big suitcases no lift 
Hotel Cavendish, The kettle and the wifi Wifi kept crashing which was very annoying The kettle in my room had some sediment that was floating in it even if I thoroughly rinsed it and so I could not make myself a cuppa 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms I ve stayed in are very small this isn t such as issue for me staying for 1 night but if you were staying longer it could feel a touch claustrophobic The bathroom similarly has the toilet sink and shower cubicle packed in pretty close together 
Hotel Cavendish, No A C a bit noisy dark room with view of unmaintained garden kitchen boiler exhaust Location good but expensive in comparison with other hotels that I have preferred No breakfast until 07 30 so not really aiming at business travellers 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, This place is the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen in my life If I could have imagined that such places exist I would never have booked a room there Booking com was not explicit about the type of room I was being offered and the price did not indicate what I was going to find on arrival What I was offered was not a room but a cupboard with a tiny bed in a niche overlooking an overgrown dirty backyard with no light and no ventilation There was no space to open my suitcase even I would not call this a room or offer it for 85 This was a disgrace on the part of both the hotel and your website I did not sleep in the room and of course there was no refund This was the first time I used booking com and I think it will be the last Very poor quality hotel no value for money and no explicit information to customers about the disgraceful state of the so called room that was on offer 
Hotel Cavendish, Just a little tired
Hotel Cavendish, Room small Bathroom even smaller and not particularly clean No air conditioning Entrance needs a revamp in fact the hotel could do with a complete revamp 
Hotel Cavendish, There was a water pump in our bathroom room 306 In the first night in only started when we turned on the hot water Second night was 3 seconds on 2 seconds off All night Couldn t sleep all night We informed the reception desk at about 8pm and asked to fix the problem or change our room We were promised the problem will be fixed When we returned there was another guy at the reception who said he did not work there and the problem was the same After a horrible night before our checking out we asked to talk to the manager but we were told he cannot be contacted because it s Saturday We want our money back 180 pounds night Can anybody help us 
Hotel Cavendish, Overall scruffy impression of entire property room extremely noisy close to busy street and windows not at all soundproof WiFi very poor 
Hotel Cavendish, Cups washed up each day they stayed dirty all week in the end I left them in breakfast Room and took two clean ones also all week I don t think the room was hovered When my key didn t work to get in room I waited 20 mins in reception no one there I phoned the number twice no one came
Hotel Cavendish, Some of the furnishings were slightly tired and older The bathroom had an odour and I wondered if it was the drains which could easily be resolved with bleach or something similar 
Hotel Cavendish, Carpet is utterly dirty so is the rest of the hotel Unprofessional stuff 
Hotel Cavendish, Room location G4 behind reception and next to main stairs noisy Room was grubby dull miserable Curtains didn t fit rail window shutters rotting at the top falling off the wall carpet dirty shower room toilet filthy hairs and dirt Looked like the room was an afterthought Complementary toiletries consisted of 3 bars of soap nothing else Room was a double but only one cup and saucer and no glasses Overall VERY POOR would not recommend to anyone
Hotel Cavendish, Access to the room wasn t good as I had to walk up 2 flights of stairs through 3 fire doors and down 2 flights of stairs to reach it It was a ground floor room with window wide open on arrival not very safe for a lone female traveller The room was not properly cleaned after the first night bed not made only one of the two bins emptied and dirty cup left The Breakfast was ok but staff got part of order wrong on first day For the price I was disappointed
Hotel Cavendish, Ripp off even for London Small room under the roof sold as 4 star en suite bedroom for 3 people Stinky hot and loud tiny bath cabin rusty thin sofa bed which was not even prepared dirty sock of a prior guest under the bed Dirty entrance mediocre breakfast indifferent staff Don t go 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is really run down The room was not cleaned for a long time I am sure and the amount of dust on the floor and in the closet was unbelievable The fruits that were served in breakfast were picked two weeks ago or so When I had breakfast not a single guest touched them I could not flush the toilets so I reported and the guy said ah yes we know that there is such a problem from time to time when the fuse goes wrong Aha you knew but you charged for the room didn t you If this was not enough at night there was no hot water for a shower Luckily I did not stay more than two days 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, There were a few areas of the room that were untidy ie the shower finishings and a little dusty in some areas 
Hotel Cavendish, Cleaningless they forgot to clean our room Breakfast hey have a very poor breakfast on the coffe was good 
Hotel Cavendish, This definitely not a four star hotel We stayed on campsites that were cleaner and safer than this hotel Our room was tiny and had mould all over the wall the window was broken and open to a construction structure that is holding the building from collapsing The tiles in the room bathroom were broken with gaps in the floor We felt very itchy when we were in the room and had bad allergies very dusty and dirty room Staff were incredibly rude and are mainly backpackers or recent arrivals to the UK who completely miss the point of customer service We had an instance where we required assistance in our room and staff just hang up the phone on us 3 times for simply asking whether the hotel provides shampoo and body wash After multiple calls we were informed they forgot to order any usually I ll be ok with this but not sure why they hang up in our face We had to walk through the kitchen area to get to our room which feels like an worn out tiny attic Staff were very noise because of gaps in the kitchen ceiling we could hear them speak at random hours at night very loudly They also wake up early for their shift and have random chats outside our door I m shocked that Booking com doesn t verify descriptions and hotel ratings provided and allow a hotel like this to advertise a 4 5 star rating Highly upsetting and concerning 
Hotel Cavendish, Frankly the single en suite room was insulting for the price charged The window would not open the cords on the pulley system had been severed and the room was only as wide as the length of a single bed There was hardly room to swing a cat in it I complained to reception about the window and was moved to another single room where the window did open but only because toilet roll was wedged beneath the window to create an opening I was put in a different room for my final second night to compensate which was a much more spacious triple room 
Hotel Cavendish, Very dirty the carpets stinks a holiday caravan have bigger toilets and shawers very noice imposible to sleep due to the noice smell and especially the bed was horrendous the patio which you can see from the bedroom window looks like a rubbish storage I travel very often around the world for business and pleasure this hotel is by far the worst hotel ever have the misfortune to visit I will never recommend to any one my night in this hotel was a TORTURE 
Hotel Cavendish, Bed was uncomfortable tiles on bathroom floor were loose and cracked this place definitely needs refurbishing no teaspoon in room and twice had to ask for milk in room 
Hotel Cavendish, I had trouble with the t v When I alerted staff that the remote wasn t working they didn t fix it They said they would but didn t they left the remote sitting there without any batteries I was able to get one channel by using the knobs on the t v itself but had to stand on the bed to reach them Not very satisfactory I asked staff to book me a taxi but they booked a car service which was much more expensive I didn t realize it was a car service until it showed up They did get me to confirm the price and I knew I was paying far too much but I tend not to argue or negotiate I feel vulnerable when I have to catch a plane and need transportation to get to the airport or train station This is a small thing but I was in Paris prior to going to London and I was able to get ice from the staff in reception at two different hotels Ice at Hotel Cavendish was definitely not to be had It s very North American of me to want ice but there you go I do 
Hotel Cavendish, The bathroom was very smelly No smoke detector Could do with a redecorate On check in and check out no staff in reception 
Hotel Cavendish, Unfortunately the weather was a little poor within our stay but there is not a lot that can be done about that 
Hotel Cavendish, Rooms The hotel is very small so they had to use up every space possible Our first night they put us at the LG1 bigger room but it was right next to the kitchen it was loud by 5am The bed was extremely firm The next day they moved us to a bigger room than what we would ve gotten originally G1 which was a lot quieter away from the kitchen n the streets But the bed was very small little bit smaller than double but better firm wise than the LG1 It worked out great for us because I like to snuggle to my husband anyway Our neighbors was loud in leaving in the morning slamming their door The rooms have no A C so we had to keep our windows open to let the cool air come in Fortunately enough the air does get cool enough at night but I can t imagine during the hot summer The window at our G1 room can t stay open on the bottom had to put a kettle to hold it open Stairs no elevator Our first night we stayed at LG that was only one floor down When we got moved to G floor supposedly the same floor as the reception room but you have to go down one floor go through the breakfast room n up one floor to get to our G room 
Hotel Cavendish, For brakfast to wait z15 minutes for seating The room below ground level wit bars at the window Shower nowhere you could Hold Yourself and very slippery Needs in many places to be renovated Very dangerous stairs to the room and breakfast room The price of Pound 275 for two nights by far too high Page of booking com Shows four stars should be maximum three Due to the bad information on your side it partly spoiled our holiday 
Hotel Cavendish, You pay a lot for a hostel because I can not consider that a hotel The room is very small old no really clean The waitress are not good never hello bye can I help you I am not saying that I need that they smile or be friendly but you are working with customers you have to have a different attitude They don t have a room where you can keep your luggages so if you arrive before 14 00 you have to leave them in the middle of the reception I am very disappointed with Hotel Cavendish 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was a bit small and could use some updated painting lampshades etc 
Hotel Cavendish, The room we were located in was next door to the breakfast room and so we had early wake ups everyday as the staff were setting up and from then on until breakfast had ended The breakfast room was small and couldn t always accommodate all those that were staying as it was always busy on one day us having to wait for an hour for a table to become available The room was also located near the staff entrance from the street and so again was always fairly noisy 
Hotel Cavendish, This was a typical budget hotel in London a little drearier and mustier in its furniture and decor than some of the other Gower Street hotels The windows wouldn t stay open so it was impossible to get fresh air and even when the temperature was pleasant outside it was sweltering and stuffy in the room The rooms are very tiny and cramped so if you need to spend any time in your room or hotel to work or attend to business this hotel is not a good choice There is no place to sit besides on the bed itself The poor water pressure was to be expected in a London hotel in this price range The breakfast is pretty standard except for the instant coffee which I found disappointing even in comparison to other hotels in this price range While the bathroom and washable bedding seemed clean the carpets and curtains and decorative pillows badly need to be freshened up I don t think they re dirty exactly but they smell musty and look very worn 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are very small which would be ok if there was a place to put the suit case under the bed for example Coffee from fresh beans was only available on certain mornings the other days it was instant coffee that was served with breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, The room location on the ground floor my door opened onto the back garden i was woken up in the early hours most nights by numerous situations due to room location 
Hotel Cavendish, no problem to offer to client stinky and overheated room under the roof with some pipes problems with explanation due to weather conditions very unprofessional
Hotel Cavendish, The worst value for money I ve had in London There is no way it s worth 130 per night In terrible need of redecoration Had the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Will never stay here again Terrible 
Hotel Cavendish, No lift and we were on the 3rd floor No aircon so baking hot Decor very tired and some in poor condition Bathroom smelled musty Breakfast was rubbish everything microwaved Could not use garden as overgrown 
Hotel Cavendish, It suited us just fine
Hotel Cavendish, I liked nothing 
Hotel Cavendish, Double room was so small that we could not walk with our bags at the floor Room was dusty and breakfast was bad Very old building Photos posted do not represent reality 
Hotel Cavendish, Public liability insurance went out if date 2009 Room exceedingly small No glasses no drinking water no hairdryer Breakfast was rushed and staff were task orientated Asking us how we want our eggs cooked whilst we are still choosing cereals Breakfast was cheap ingredients and tepid Wardrobe full of dust Loose wires everywhere No one asked us if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was plain just adequate Most mornings serviced instant coffee and for over 120 UK pounds per night 
Hotel Cavendish, Extra sofa bed was very uncomfortable had to sleep on top of the duvet covered with sheets No possibility for an extra duvet Tights stairs and hallways but only annoying when carrying large bags Breakfast a bit boring small portions but you could get refills PS Short breakfast time 7 30 9 30 all days 
Hotel Cavendish, It was not the cleanest hotel I had hairs in the shower but it was great they cleaned my sheets and bathroom every day I also had no bin in my room which was not the best 
Hotel Cavendish, Cobwebs on the curtains and ceiling At 8am we were told the kitchen ran out of coffee at breakfast Other guests queried if it is possible to go buy some The staff ignored any voice of inconvenience People next door smoked Staff did not bother 
Hotel Cavendish, Not a 4 hotel Room was very adequate in need of refurbishment Room very hot and noisy as next to breakfast room Bathroom poor 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny a cabin Booking com says it s a 4 star hotel but really it only deserves 2 5 stars No drinking glass soap dish or accessible mirror in the bathroom Poor shower Wifi mediocre No fridge Saw mice in the dining room one evening Poor management 
Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom was very poor with visible damages on the walls and equipment No stands for soap or shampoo no wentilation often lackin towels 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Decor in hotel was tired Narrow staircase which could possibly prove difficult for older people Ceiling in bedroom obviously had problems with dampness Breakfast was disappointing Full English breakfast consisted of 1 egg 1 rasher of bacon 1 sausage baked beans and 1 small cooked tomato However there was a choice of cereals and fruit and also toast Staff pleasant 
Hotel Cavendish, Originally booked the cabin room then upgraded via you to a single room but on arrival told I had to have the cabin no upgrade from you he said Would not tell me if there was a single room available or not Spent dreadful sleepless night right up against a draughty old window with street noise etc so asked to be upgraded the next morning even to a double room told no upgrade from you but when I presented your print out was then moved later in the day to a single room which was fine and had secondary glazing re traffic noise Their www site which boasts a refurbishment is none sense a cushion and a useless short bed cover You really should consider de listing this place What use is a wardrobe with only one coat hanger ETC ETC ETC Its a tired distressed place in much need of the refurbishment they claim to have made Would have to think twice about using your site again sorry but just not good enough all round But they did not charge me for the upgrade on the second night Breakfast was good with a hardworking staff P S TV remote did not work on the second night
Hotel Cavendish, Our room was in the basement so wifi connection wasn t great There were bars on the windows which could be a fire hazard Breakfast was basic 
Hotel Cavendish, The size of the rooms is too small the bare wooden floors not welcoming the kettle in my room didn t quite work the breakfast staff wasn t particularly friendly 
Hotel Cavendish, Pathetically small room MICE not cleaned properly cracked sink poor shower noisy computer says no staff refused to refund even breakfast I wasn t going to eat there I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and this ranks as one of the worst anywhere in the world 
Hotel Cavendish, I booked a cabinn The room was very very small the windows was broken and room temperature was around 12 degrees The room was so small and dark that everything seemed dirty Cracks in the sealing with discoloring around them Bathroom floor was ice cold I booked it for two days left after one with no refund of the second day but would not stay there a day more for obvious reasons So Please think twice before booking a cabinn and don t do it if the quality of the room matters to you 
Hotel Cavendish, Nothing really The single room was very small but comfortable and ideal for what I needed There are no complaints at all 
Hotel Cavendish, Mice running around in pairs towards the dinning room When the staff were informed they seemed unbothered by the news and certainly didn t leap into action No refund for the breakfast which was included in the price despite protestations that I was certainly NOT going to vie with rodents for my breakfast Three blind mice has been playing in my head since my stay I never did find the third and I m not sure if I m glad about that or not The description kept stating it was in Camden I m not sure if this is a ploy to attract tourists but this place is nowhere near Camden town unless they moved the British Museum while I wasn t looking It is central London but that s about the only thing going for it imo 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was the smallest I have ever slept in There was no lift The room telephone did not work It took one and a half hours and 3 requests to receive 1 drinking glass for the bathroom It was cold in the night 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable the hotel is in much need of an overhaul and renovation The hall light shines into the bedrooms all through the night and the busy main road makes sleeping hard The outside noise isn t the hotels fault 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was cramped and sofa bed not good mold and missing tiles in bathroom and a half hour queue for toast cereals excepted so much more for the money paid
Hotel Cavendish, No noise isolation at all 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was dirty and extremly small Double bed means you can sleep with your partner only in 69 what we reported immediately after checking in they said the room will be changed to a bigger one in the morning but they didn t do it 
Hotel Cavendish, The room size would be better described as a large cupboard with the suitcases on the floor there was literally no access to the en suite
Hotel Cavendish, Bed was not even double size Mattress was with mountain in the middle we was sliding of it Water stains on the ceiling Shower head not fitting the handle Breakfast very poor We had view of a building site Stairs was so wonky we was afraid to step on it When my husband asks for water for the kettle he was sent to the kitchen with the finger point colect his on watter Very unpleasant experience
Hotel Cavendish, Worst hotel I have ever been The single room was so small that I could touch the walls with my open arms No forniture whatsoever no chair closet table In three days I was there the room was never tied up or cleaned towel never changed Breakfast was pretty bad just English breakfast and cereal with cold milk
Hotel Cavendish, Water pressure from taps was very low Wifi kept dropping off Basement room could hear water pipes draining from all floors above day and night 
Hotel Cavendish, With Shower head stuck up 2m high and no shower cups available it is impossible for a woman to have a shower Heating in the hotel was not working for 2 out our 4 nights
Hotel Cavendish, very uncomfortable room smallest I have ever been to Not clean the sheets were stained Room service did not clean the room Very cold the heater did not work at all Wifi was not available at all times I do not recommend Better conditions are offered in other hotels on the same street 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, The bed is a little narrow and next to the single glazed window in 110 so I was a bit chilly A spare blanket would have solved this 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room was very small Had to queue and wait for tables Service was quick but didn t have time to finish cereal before main breakfast bought out Bed linen was clean but other furnishings such as ripped net curtains need replacing Sink blocked in bathroom 
Hotel Cavendish, Asked for quiet room when booking but were given a room immediately next to breakfast room Awoken at 6am to sound of clanking pots and plates Also no milk for morning tea in room Asked receptionist for some and was told there wasn t anything available Never stayed anywhere that didn t have pots of uht milk or even coffee mate for tea coffee in room Also breakfast had no orange juice available asked waitress 3 times but kept forgetting to bring it out Will not stay here again 
Hotel Cavendish, There were cobwebs on the ceiling and the net curtains were grey and stained with paint but apart from that the room and bathroom seemed clean Our bedroom was on the lower ground floor adjacent to the breakfast room and the window of our bedroom faced out towards the kitchen Essentially then our room was between the kitchen and the breakfast room Therefore we were woken at 5am by the sounds coming from the kitchen and breakfast room as the catering staff were preparing This was not the fault of the staff it was just due to where the room was located The stairs are winding and carpeted unevenly so climbing them felt a little unsafe 
Hotel Cavendish, Drafty sash windows Couldn t close bathroom door once inside due to lack of space but ok as it was a single room 
Hotel Cavendish, The cleaners the hotel was non existent the shower had mould and dirt all over the tiles when having a wash in the sink the water is not going down the hole and raw sewage was coming up from the pipes not nice dust and dirt all over
Hotel Cavendish, 7 30 start to breakfast too late when working in London Room tiny Couldn t even sit on toilet as wall in front No light switch near bed Room scruffy
Hotel Cavendish, Though the toilet shower was clean the tiles on the floor were damaged and loose Not good to walk on barefoot They could easily be repaired but looked to have been this way for quite sometime The additional single sofa bed made the room cramped when opened Could have done with a little more thought in the layout of furniture I was tempted to move things around myself The double bed was comfortable but my daughter had difficulty sleeping on the overly hard sofa bed 
Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom smelled of stale pipes
Hotel Cavendish, I had booked a cabin bedroom due to it being cheap The room was extremely small and as such felt like an in fill BUT this was what I had booked so if you want an inexpensive room clean and ensuite near major rail connections this was adequate The soundproofing from above however was poor and it was not a smart hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Bed was too small room too small no chair to sit on shower leaked into bathroom floor as door didn t seal Basement room meAnt no view for the 3 days we were there
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast worst i have ever had they didnt understand english we came 5mins before the closure and they didnt give us breakfast Noise in the room Fire Alarm early morning woke up us and we didnt get any compensation 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny I had a single bed duvet on a double bed The water pressure volume flow was very little in the bathroom sink and shower No veggie English breakfast options No pastries for breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, The whole section of the hotel we were in smelt of the bacon from breakfast permanently The ensuite had loose tiles on the floor the fan was so full of fluff it didn t work the shower was tiny We had to wait 20 minutes for a table for breakfast as there was no where near enough tables or staff 
Hotel Cavendish, Stale smell throughout property Very dated and tired throughout Dirty lack of cleanliness Tiny bathroom Toilet was in the way of standing at the basin Shower curtain as old as me Basin so small you couldn t fill the kettle under the taps Windows dirty and paint peeling off Lovely view of scaffolding outside the window to our room Went down for breakfast the first morning no seats available Were told we had to wait until somebody finished their breakfast before we could have ours A lady in the kitchen was plating up breakfast using her fingers Picking up sausages and bacon with her bare hands We did not have the breakfast on the sat or sun of our stay for obvious reasons When we asked to see the management we were told he only works mon fri 
Hotel Cavendish, Towels could do with being bigger and water in the room would be a good idea 
Hotel Cavendish, Wi fi was temperamental we just avoided it in the end and used our 4G Full English breakfast consisted of 1 bacon 1 sausage very good though 1 egg half a tomato and some beans Not quite full and not exactly hearty There was cereal and toast plenty to eat but if you are hoping for plenty of pastries or a full English you need to manage your expectations Still fabulous for the price given the location 
Hotel Cavendish, Ants in the room it had a door to the garden and I can only assume they were crawling in under it 
Hotel Cavendish, Room felt very dated and a bit old The sofa bed very very uncomfortable could do with a different matteress could feel springs Bathroom had mould on celing dirty in there 
Hotel Cavendish, See previous comment
Hotel Cavendish, Gower St can be noisy so possibly a problem if you have a room at the front of the hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Outside Downstairs room looks up to pavement and out onto rotten boards and mop bucket was described double bed was 2 singles of different sizes pushed together kitchen other side of wall woken up during the night as staff had break and at 6 30 each morning room not well cleaned bed linen was clean Take care when using electrics as sockets are not in good condition 
Hotel Cavendish, Fewer stairs but not a problem
Hotel Cavendish, The room we stayed in was a family room however the extra bed was a very uncomfortable sofa bed which when it was pulled out left NO ROOM in the bedroom the shower was less than adequate and the bathroom could do with a deep clean the towels were not changed nor beds made for the two days we stayed there Our room was in the basement which looked out onto a rather dirty back yard this room should not be used for paying guests 
Hotel Cavendish, Dirty furnishings loose toilet seat very poor customer service the staff were terrible Breakfast room in the basement with not enough seating Would not recommend to anyone
Hotel Cavendish, Dim light in room drab worn out decor Very very noisy thin walls such that you can hear everything going on in rooms next door and in the corridor Stains on walls and carpets cleaning standards dubious Very small room All in all if you need somewhere to just crash for the night but can afford not to sleep very well as a result of the noise then it s ok I think if you don t have many expectations then you probably won t have any complaints but I think the hotel has been advertised as something that it isn t It s not a 3 or 4 star hotel as shown on some websites At best it s a 1 5 star guesthouse If that s made clear when advertising then it ll probably get better reviews I went in expecting something of slightly higher standard will make sure I do my research better next time 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is filthy the bedding absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke The windows are broken 72 steps down then back up again to breakfast Would not recommend or return 
Hotel Cavendish, This is NOT a 4 stars hotel please review your classification Wooden floor under carpet just a bit noisy No good sofa bed for third person but we found the way to sleep First time in my life I have to pay when checking in
Hotel Cavendish, 3rd floor room no lift stairs narrow and sloppy not at all advisable to customer with luggage These information should be clear before booking Non complimetary whater available we had to ask Bathroom noisy every time you open tap or flush water a pump starts with noisy Room too small Bagage needed to be piled up Third bed not ready we asked to prepare it with some disconfort room too narrow Garbage bin not empty from previous customer I would not recomed this hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Sofa bed was uncomfortable 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel was way to hot Made sleeping very difficult also there was an old smoke smell to the room We had a triple room and the fold out bed was very uncomfortable 
Hotel Cavendish, This was not a 4 hotel and we were put in a basement room right by the breakfast room It was therefore dark small very basic and noisy in the morning 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was awful greasy undercooked and burnt How Really run down in d cor Fire alarm went off at 4 30am and no apology from staff and no visible marshalls Had to clean bathroom before use 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms looked tired but clean During the night we could hear what sounded like a washing machine or water tank filling above us for most of the night 
Hotel Cavendish, The breakfast was a disappointment First morning we had to wait to get a table And in two days we never got the right things that we orderd One morning at 8 00 the beans was not ready the breakfast starts at 7 30 The other days we went out to eat our breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, There was a fire alarm from 5 am to 7 am on two consecutive mornings No one checked whether I was alive or dead and when I asked to speak to a manager on checking out to sort out a refund I was told to be quiet by an insensitive and unprofessional young man whilst his colleague laughed and agreed with me that he was not in a position to tell me to be quiet 4 days later I have still heard nothing from them about any recompense and I am disgusted with their customer service 
Hotel Cavendish, Our room was roasting hot You couldn t turn the radiators down and it s noisy to open the window There were hairs in the bed Linen didn t appear very clean Bathroom smelt like a sewer Tv remote didn t work 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was cold as the windows are big but single glazed bed is right next to them and radiator is small and far from bed Bathroom needed some cleaning and shower isntt good 
Hotel Cavendish, Stayed here for 1 night away with work and moved rooms 3 times Tiny rooms unclean unhelpful staff and the much needed free Wi Fi kept cutting out Luckily only stayed 1 night couldn t wait to get out the next morning 
Hotel Cavendish, we booked Triple room but there are a big double bed and a sofa which is uncomfortable so much so we had to sleep all togather in double bed also hotel was crazy extremly hot 
Hotel Cavendish, The wifi was really slow didn t work properly The room was tiny but served my overnight business stay perfectly the bed would have been too small for a tall person 
Hotel Cavendish, The bathroom was disgusting and smelt of damp the door squeked and the floor tiles were cracked and harbouring all sorts of I don t know what 
Hotel Cavendish, If you are travelling alone the single rooms will fall short of your expectation The rooms are very small and claustrophobic Beds are pushed up against windows with terrible drafts I had to use my clothes to seal window and a suitcase to protect myself from draft Very uncomfortable When asked to change to another room the same situation 
Hotel Cavendish, Shower in cabin room tad small No soap holder Overall maybe a little updated decorating 
Hotel Cavendish, The cabin room truly was a cabin room Very comfortable but very small
Hotel Cavendish, Quite noisy people banging doors late at night Coffee tea etc not always replaced daily nor cup and saucer washed 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was small and the waitress got our order wrong 
Hotel Cavendish, The kettle didn t work properly and the tea coffee facilities lacked milk Bed was a bit hard 
Hotel Cavendish, I was in a room at the front of the hotel which was a bit noisy cars from the main road but it s the heart of London so I can t say I was too surprised 
Hotel Cavendish, Room is very dated This is definaltly not a 4star hotel Although you simply sleep as you re out and about all day it would be nice if your room was clean and tidied I e Beds made bins emptied This does not happen 
Hotel Cavendish, I can t really fault anything though a cup of Earl Grey would have earned an extra point for breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, The late shift guys at the desk had no clue about anything Could not even show me how to operate the safe in my room as there were no instructions 
Hotel Cavendish, The shower has some grime in it however I could still wash 
Hotel Cavendish, The hair in the tea cup wasn t pleasant The shower had practically no water pressure
Hotel Cavendish, The cleaning in the shower room was disgusting The windows in the room are single glass so you eart the noise outside 
Hotel Cavendish, I can t think of anything that could improve For the price you pay I think it is a very good deal
Hotel Cavendish, I was under the impression that this was a 4 hotel as this is how it appeared on the site It is not I could have booked another hotel which would have suited us better with very little extra outlay The pictures are deceiving to say the least 
Hotel Cavendish, When we arrived and got our room it was a big chunk of hair in the shower I went to the reception and told them this and they said they would arrange it It was in the shower during out whole stay Room wasnt very clean either and we found hair basicly everywhere They could use a vacuumcleaner During our stay they only cleaned the room once Wifi really bad to Sometimes it worked and sometimes not and when it worked it was very slow 
Hotel Cavendish, It is listed as a 4 star hotel which it isn t There is no lift which isn t mention and there is noone to help drag the cases up one or two flights of stairs Bathroom facilities ridiculous room small and squashed
Hotel Cavendish, The double bed it was really really tiny for a couple The blanket almost cover us The small was really small The pictures don t reflect reality Bit dissapointed with the room for a 85 room I was expecting a much better quality 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room not big enough to cater for all quests so had to share a table 
Hotel Cavendish, No lift And no lactose free milk for lactose infolerant people 
Hotel Cavendish, Everything check out the photos 
Hotel Cavendish, Rooms a bit small and only showers no bath
Hotel Cavendish, Avoid front rooms due to noise on Gower street WiFi stopped working 
Hotel Cavendish, It looked like there was no hot water in the shower when I arrived day time Single room was tiny I couldn t open my suitcase properly It was quite cold in the room due to the windows being badly sealed radiators were quite warm there was a lot of dust under the furniture
Hotel Cavendish, There was a water tank above our bedroom LG4 which had running water all night long It only stopped every so often as it seemed to be emptying and refilling As soon as the water was being used in the morning it stopped running the water It did keep us awake quite a bit 
Hotel Cavendish, I booked a single cabin room and what I got were two tiny closets one the bathroom one the bedroom connected by a tiny entry hall Smaller than expected but manageable However The bathroom had no heat source and direct access through the ventilation fan to the outside The radiator in the bedroom couldn t compete with the cold air coming in through the poorly sealed window Because of these things the bathroom was absolutely freezing and the bedroom was quite cold The sink in the bathroom was clogged it would fill almost completely every time I used it and then take several minutes to drain I complained about it twice to no avail although I was told the second time that the man looked at it and found a small cap from toothpaste or similar inside It continued to be a problem I gave up on complaining The bathroom walls and ceiling had visible mold and the ceiling was covered in droplets of condensation that would occasionally unexpectedly fall as little icy surprises The lamp in the bedroom though unnecessary was visibly broken There was only one outlet in the whole of the room behind the door and I had to move the table to it in order to plug in and use the kettle which was filthy when I arrived The wardrobe contained only two hangers making unpacking impossible Living out of a suitcase in such a tiny space was difficult to say the least The wifi connection was terrible or non existent throughout my stay When I asked about the poor quality of the connection it was suggested that I try connecting to the password free wifi of the hotel next door 
Hotel Cavendish, well the room was not very clean bed was not comfortable the room didnt have glasses for a drink one bin which was in toilet very small the tv wouldnt turn off was locked out of room cos the batteries on the door didnt work for 2 days was not worth the money wouldnt stay there again 
Hotel Cavendish, shower walls could do with a bit more cleaning a refridgerator in room would be an improvement 
Hotel Cavendish, Absolutely terrible rooms and cleanliness is so bad Please don t be like me booking based on the picture the room space and the picture promoted is fraud please just dont book here there are elsewhere better worth for money 
Hotel Cavendish, No lift no one to pick or bring down the luggage breakfast was average toilet was small carpets were dirty
Hotel Cavendish, 1 The extra bed was not very comfortable 2 The breakfast room was too small we have to wait for a table 3 Nothing in the bedroom to put our stuff on same thing on the bathroom
Hotel Cavendish, The fact that there is no lift and to find the room we had to walk like through a maze A lot of stairs and with luggages is a hessle
Hotel Cavendish, Bed was terribly uncomfortable it was stated as a double but was two singles pushed together each with very saggy mattresses It felt like you were sleeping down a slope The room could also do with a refurb and a few bodges sorting out 
Hotel Cavendish, For some reason on the second day the time of the breakfast changed without anybody letting us know Not ideal for our planning 
Hotel Cavendish, a bit cold in the bed due to old windows but the sheets were thick enough could be cleaner doesn t refill shampoo unless asked
Hotel Cavendish, wifi was unacceptably bad Couldn t really use it Moved rooms but it did not help For someone here on business staying for over a week this is a major issue Would stay again if this was sorted
Hotel Cavendish, Door facing towards outside had a gap so it was quite drafty through the hole It was ground floor si the room had two doors one on the hall and the other one with the gap 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was so small like a prison cell which overlooked anunmainfained back garden The shows was dirty and the hotel decor was off poor quality The hotel smelt like stale cigarettes too

Hotel Cavendish, The shower head was broken no toiletries amd had to wait for a table at breakfast
Hotel Cavendish, Room was a bit smelly and very small but we didn t really spend a lot of time in the room so wasn t a big issue 
Hotel Cavendish, Luggage deposited was not locked away could have been taken away by anyone Breakfast is too plain and simple for such a pricey hotel Room is too small and not at all 4 star quality No aircon only one dusty fan There s really better hotels like Park Plaza Westminister offered at similar rate 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was in need of some modernisation and was very small the hall carpets had holes in it the bathroom had mould on the tiles this was not a four star hotel moor like a cheap b b very disappointing we will not be going back 
Hotel Cavendish, We were a group of 20 colleagues We had booked a few single rooms and a few double rooms but unfortunately we didn t notice that those double rooms also had double beds I noticed one week before arrival and so I immediately called the hotel The receptionist was very relaxed and told me to call back one day before arrival he would sort everything out I arrived one day before arrival of the group and headed straight to the hotel Nothing was arranged the same guy told me to check on arrival the next day When we arrived the next day it was another receptionist who wasn t informed at all I explained everything again and gave him our rooming list so he could prepare everything for when we would check in late in the evening Finally when we arrived another receptionist was not informed So I had to explain everything again for the 4th time We spent 30 minutes after a very long day to sort out all the rooms Not professional at all The breakfast was not that great either It was very dark in the room as the lights were broken I ordered scrambled eggs and had fried eggs luckily this was replaced immediately Not much bread available only toast The shower was verrry cold and then semi hot and then freezing cold again 
Hotel Cavendish, Drafty window
Hotel Cavendish, Very old fixed shower unit needs upgrading Two single beds to make a double very uncomfortable No rubbish bin in room No glasses provided in room 
Hotel Cavendish, Plates were not clean enough during the breakfast Also I was staying in a small room which was fine but the only place where I could hang my jacket was the bathroom or put on the floor 
Hotel Cavendish, Dirty needs repair breakfast room was a poorly decorated greasy spoon affair with plastic table cloth 
Hotel Cavendish, Service at breakfast was incredibly poor Completely ignored for 10 minutes whilst other people were acknowledged and had drinks made for them We got our own tea in the end and waited to try and order breakfast Again other people who arrived after us managed to be served and order their breakfast Finally our invisibility seemed to go and we ordered our food which unfortunately was then wrong even after repeating it to two separate people One spoke better English but seemingly scrambled egg on toast is a difficult request I d recommend skipping breakfast and going somewhere with staff who know about customer service 
Hotel Cavendish, Bedroom was above the breakfast area the stench of egg for the whole 3x days ruined the experience I booked the room on booking com but emailed the hotel as instructed by the front desk to request that they charge the credit card given to take my email as authorisation This was ignored and resulted in the guests paying out of their own pocket which was not my request 
Hotel Cavendish, Photos in no way relate to the quality of the room Some of the staff spoke very little English Bathroom smelt disgusting Window failed to stay open Room had a double bed shoe horned in Not worth the money paid for this room 
Hotel Cavendish, Coldest tiniest room I ve ever stayed in my life No extra blanket was given 
Hotel Cavendish, Room The tiniest room ever Could easily hear sounds from the room s upstairs Breakfast Absolutely nothing healthy for breakfast no veggies no natural yogurt no ham All products of low value and poor quality those who love Kellog s cereal will be happy though as hotel has huge selection of them Internet sometimes works sometimes not 
Hotel Cavendish, Single rooms are tiny Bathrooms are very small
Hotel Cavendish, The building contents are a bit shabby worn 
Hotel Cavendish, Too small room the room was like a closet And untidy The carpet was full of ingrained dirt Layers of dust in the gap between the bed and the window did not want to drop anything there 
Hotel Cavendish, such a costly and apparently a 4 star hotel worst hotel I have ever stayed narrow room no facilities breakfast was also not good should not cost that much for such a service and type of rooms in this hotel will never go there photos in booking com for this hotel are really misleading 
Hotel Cavendish, Tired rooms and the breakfast was very small but very tasty We were in the lower ground rooms and there was loads of road noise due to no double glazing plus the actual windows rattled in the frames when anything went by Shower was little more than a trickle in one room the TVs were ancient and the remotes didn t work very well In my opinion it s a 50 room not the 125 we spent each It would have loads of potential they need to invest It was OK for a quick overnight stay but one poor nights sleep was enough for us 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms were not safe The windows had a very unsecured lock and their is scaffolding outside I was shown three rooms before i found one that I felt safe in top floor The bathroom was very smelly they helpfully left a bottle of febreze to help with the problem 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast room was small and we had to wait a while for a table Hotel layout was odd confusing 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is very dated and common areas including stairways require attention Layout of hotel made it difficult to navigate 
Hotel Cavendish, Bedroom was like a single room bed was tiny Breakfast was not at 6 30 but 7 30 so we missed out altogether Staff were not interested when we questioned both 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel was more of a guest house Room was small and decor a little dull tired 
Hotel Cavendish, TV didn t work 1st day told the engineer would come the next day Told the same again the following day 1st night the window wouldn t close And as we faced the street was noisy Second night it was closed and couldn t be opened The shower was grubby Coffee in the room was foul
Hotel Cavendish, Incompetent porter unavailable to supply a 3 duve for the 3rd bed in a booked 3 bed room one guest had to use a sheet Also the third bed was the worst bed ever with springs sticking up your bag And finally the room was very small in the basement and next to the kitchen with the noise and smells you would expect And as we were forced to pay for two nights over weekend even we only needed one it was not because it was cheap One hotel I need not to see again 
Hotel Cavendish, Entrance to rooms is going into stairs then opening doors while holding the luggage needed a health and safety risk assessment single room is too small no housekeeper after 6 pm 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was not nice at all it had nothing to do with the photos the floor on the bathroom was broken there were doing constructions outside the window and it was noisy we had booked a three bed room and they gave us a room with one double bed and a couch where 3 people could hardly fit in The staff was ignorant seemed very bored with their work We thanked them in the end for the accommodation and they were too busy with their papers to say at least thank you for staying with us such a disappointment 
Hotel Cavendish, Of course the room was very tiny I couldn t afford a larger one That makes it difficult to stay for an extended period of time 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Don t think there should be a room behind reception which I found uncomfortable and had to change rooms After changing rooms the bed leaning had blood on it wasn t happy with that at all which put me off 
Hotel Cavendish, No cups or glasses in room although plenty of coffee and teas and biscuits No iron 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast looked like it would be good excellent range of cereals and fresh fruit It all went downhill on the cooked I was offered bacon and sausage as part of a vegetarian breakfast I opted for baked beans which were cold asked for them to be warmed up a little and got them back incinerated 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel didn t provide a shower cap but I brought my own The housekeeping threw away my shower cap the first day she cleaned the room and I couldn t get my stuff back and there was no apologize or assistance on that The house keeping always forget to refill soap and toilet kits I was travelling alone and my flight back was on Sunday and I need to leave hotel early morning I had checked with the hotel reception about the tube opening hours and he said it opened from 5 am but it turned out that on Sunday the tube would open around 6 30 7 00 I need to walk to another line of tube and the time was very tight to get to the airport 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Very small and old room Poor facilities in the room TV hardly worked remote hardly worked also and they insisted on leaving it as is No where in the world this is s 4 stars hotel would give it 2 3 stars
Hotel Cavendish, It was very expensive for what was at best a two star hotel The room smelt and wasn t very clean 
Hotel Cavendish, Traffic noise Not much choice at breakfast D cor fixtures and fittings looking rather old No soap dish in shower 
Hotel Cavendish, Could maybe do with some refurbishment but considering it is in central London you get what you pay for and was of an acceptable standard for the price
Hotel Cavendish, The shower could have been slightly more powerful 
Hotel Cavendish, My double bed was made up as two singles so I kept rolling over into the crack inbetween Shower has what only can be described as having mould all over the walls Not much selection for breakfast
Hotel Cavendish, Hotel is in need of renovation there were cracks on the walls for example Cleaning wasn t very good No fridge Builders right outside our window Water pressure was terrible Breakfast was boring and quite small
Hotel Cavendish, The shower sprinkler head was in bad shape so we didn t have a nice flow of water to our bath We are from Portugal where the electric sockets are different from those of U K We forgot to take a socket adapter so we ask the guys from the hotel if they could borough us some since every hotel we have been usually has this They just told us to go out and buy one not a good service Also when we got there our daughter s bed wasn t ready yet they told us it would be ready later that afternoon When we got back it wasn t ready still so we had to wait again In the end of our stay they didn t asked us about the quality of our stay they just said bye 
Hotel Cavendish, Never keen on hotels which are converted houses Transmission of noise between rooms Cramped public spaces Poor value given its limited facilities 
Hotel Cavendish, for the price charging a 4 star price for 2 star at most The rooms ridiculously small everything was of the cheepest quality towels toileteries etc old furniture carpets bedding need I go on 
Hotel Cavendish, Wifi in the basement room where I was did not work but it did elsewhere in the hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Really bad service We have got a room in a basement without heater the man in the reception told us in the middle of the night that he doesn t have nothing to do The day after also they didn t want to listen to the problem we had and they just doesn t care about the guests It was really disappointing 
Hotel Cavendish, Room to small could hardly move and the shower room the walls are all marked puts you off going in the shower
Hotel Cavendish, I had stated on Booking com that i was vegetarian no eggs or onion when i booked the room which was around 6 weeks ahead of the travel date despite this the cooked option i was given for breakfast was 1 cooked tomato and a small helping of baked beans 
Hotel Cavendish, WiFi is quite flakey with intermittent speed problems The bathroom was clean but absolutely tiny no room to stand anywhere In general single rooms are very small though I suppose if you just use the room to sleep in that doesn t matter so much NB no elevators so if you have heavy luggage and your room is on the 3rd floor you ll be carrying that up the stairs 
Hotel Cavendish, No lift asked for 3 singles got a double and pull out No air conditioning far too hot On top floor and had difficulties getting up all the stairs too many flights And breakfast was in basement 5 flights of stairsback to room Breakfast small but ok
Hotel Cavendish, The original room I was put in was awful dirty and couldn t sit on the toilet because my legs were jammed against the wall Had to sit side saddle and I m not joking 
Hotel Cavendish, A slightly larger cooked breakfast would be good 
Hotel Cavendish, 1 The first room offered was tiny little bigger than a broom cupboard with a shower in it Not even enough space to open my large suitcase 2 The second room offered below basement level was noisy as it was on street level and the window couldn t close so the sounds were disturbing Trying to work the window left my hands greasy with dark grime Due to the noise I had to move in the early hours of the morning 3 The 3rd room was larger and quiet room 208 I think but had a damaged carpet and water damage near on the ceiling near the window It smelt musty The bathroom ceiling was mouldy above the shower I could not sit on the toilet no leg room Had to sit sideways The telephones did not work for 2 days could not dial out No instructions in the room on how to operate the phone dialing out codes reception number etc The pillows were flat hard rendering them uncomfortable to use The light shines underneath the door at night the gap is too big and needs a strip put at the bottom of the door 4 My own fault I overslept and came 15 min late for breakfast on day 1 Staff were unfriendly and I was clearly a nuisance and inconvenience to them No offer of even a piece of toast butter or jam Overall this hotel does not deserve the appellation of 4 Stars It simple misrepresentation 
Hotel Cavendish, Waited a good 15 minutes before anyone appeared at reception A total disgrace and no apology for me having to wait I was tired and just wanted to get to my room Room full of hairs grime and pieces of food on the floor I needed a shower desperately but couldn t bring myself to go in there It was just completely grotty and they clearly don t have any standards when it comes to cleanliness I had to use my elbows to flick light switches because I couldn t bear to touch anything 
Hotel Cavendish, the ground floor room 1 was a dark room which was mainly due to a filthy net curtain and scaffolding but bed and very small bathroom was clean Bed was quite comfortable 
Hotel Cavendish, The wifi was awful got better reception from the free wifi across the road at Waterstones 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small I ve never been in such a small room 
Hotel Cavendish, To be honest I didn t like it as soon as I walked in I wanted to turn around and walk out Not very clean dated uncomfortable bed Garden scruffy overgrown Would not stay there again 
Hotel Cavendish, Sausages small and breakfast not substantial One tiny sausage with one piece of bacon Half a tomato and a spoonful of beans with an egg Nothing brilliant but cooked well 
Hotel Cavendish, There s scaffolding outside the building which means anybody can climb up to any window but the cleaning staff insist on leaving the windows open Probably because there s no ventilation in the room and when you ask for a fan they keep telling you they ll get it to you later then they don t The throw pillow also smelled really mouldy but the regular pillows were fine 
Hotel Cavendish, Our room wasn t ready when we arrived despite saying on booking com our time of arrival We left our bags in reception under chairs or in the corner which I was worried about them going missing as it was a communal area The breakfast wasn t the best Small portions and tables were not ready when we went down 
Hotel Cavendish, Room a bit small Fan supplied not sufficient as London temperature rose to 31degrees
Hotel Cavendish, Small single room bonus of queen size bed though Room over noisy street meant window kept shut this kept traffic noise out altho room v hot I
Hotel Cavendish, Definitely not a four star hotel Small rooms broken tiles in the bath room not lift so it was hard to walk the steps with a stroller Poor breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, Member of staff when we arrived was rude and not interested in our questions the window in our room would not shut fully so we had all the noise from outside
Hotel Cavendish, Horrible stained mattress with no mattress cover and flat stained smelly pillows Unusable sofa bed hard springs with 2 thick mattress on top ridiculously hard 
Hotel Cavendish, All good bar room size but i understand given price
Hotel Cavendish, Room next to the kitchen and dining room so woke by the noise Shower a tad cramped and in all needs an upgrade but for the money and short stay cant grumble 
Hotel Cavendish, This is not a 4 star hotel it is a 2 star guest house No tissues 1 bottle of water between 2 on request sink plug didn t seal difficult to shave old sticker on mirror window ledge outside thick with rubbish a 2 minute cleaning job breakfast had some fresh produce but all else tinned very average no assistance to get cases up tight stairs Room was very small and very hot 
Hotel Cavendish, TV remote batteries were dead windows didn t seem very secure and took a long while to figure out how to close The shower would have been fine if you were six feet tall but as it was you couldn t alter the position it was right in my five foot six face and the flow was torrential washing my hair was very tricky 
Hotel Cavendish, The fact that I cannot to this day collect the invoice been over a month No email fax response totally ignored once you finish your stay
Hotel Cavendish, The size and layout of 1st room More a single than a double Really wasnt worth the money we spent 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was incredibly small and to use the toilet you had to put your feet outside the toilet door It was impossible to get a wi fi connection 
Hotel Cavendish, First night was a very very narrow bed for 2 in a tiny room No lift for our 2 x 20 kg suitcases Depressing place to be avoided Great need for maintenance in bathrooms 
Hotel Cavendish, The cost of the room was too high for the size offered Room layout was cramped Couldn t use the toilet without hitting legs against sink Couldn t shower without bumping into sink and toilet Bathroom mirror is above toilet instead of above sink Made it hard to shave Wifi was slow to nonexistent I found myself trying to stay away from the room as much as possible to avoid the uncomfortability 
Hotel Cavendish, The iron was the worst one I have ever used Cracked base plate and leaked everywhere The WiFi was also intermittent 
Hotel Cavendish, the only room left was advised as being very small this was correct however was clean could have done with something to hang some clothes up though as nothing provided in room even a hanger in the small bathroom on towel rail holder or wall tv stand would have done the trick 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Really really unstable and slow wifi No aircon A fox in the backyard were howling all night keeping us all awake and with the no aircon we couldn t close the window No supply of shower gel and shampoo tp water bottles at the room 
Hotel Cavendish, Room and bed were tiny should have been a single room not sold as a double with a queen size bed jammed into it Bathroom also tiny but to be expected Had 2 terrible nights sleep due to size of bed and traffic noise 
Hotel Cavendish, Nothing about this overpriced parody of a hotel Overpriced neglected tired cold Tiny shower no pressure No toilette paper TV broker Bad breakfast
Hotel Cavendish, Limited choice of food for breakfast no vegetarian option for cooked breakfast room on road so being hot ideally needed windows open but couldn t with traffic noise Improvement to in room facilities better tea coffee refreshments 
Hotel Cavendish, Everything except the kind receptionist Of course just 7 minutes to Russel square tube 
Hotel Cavendish, Our room was at the top of the hotel One small window The room was very warm but they gave us a fan And they had someone to take our cases to the room which we were greatful for 
Hotel Cavendish, No power cable for TV I didn t need the TV but strange how it wasn t there Was given phone number for front desk but no phone cable was provided for the phone Room had an outside door which was very strange but a big curtain over it thankfully and I presume it was secure Room could ve been cleaner lots of cracks in the walls etc 
Hotel Cavendish, The window in the room opened from the bottom upwards From the floor level to ceiling It was fully open when we arrived and with no safety barrier only a sheer curtain covering it this was very dangerous as you could not see the window was open we were on the 1st floor so it would have been a bad fall if someone didn t realise or tripped on the curtain there was no a c so the window was the only source of air After closing it up well down the window also dropped down from the top so I kept it open from that On return from our day trip the next day though it was fully open from the bottom again I forgot to mention it to reception but really it shouldn t need to be it s a very fundamental safety point for both adults children staying in the room 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms we were given the first day were extremely small however we were moved to bigger and better rooms the next day This is certainly not a four star hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast good but could have more choices The bed was good but a little small for two persons The Wi Fi should be better 
Hotel Cavendish, The staff were not very welcoming and barley made eye contact Had to cary cases up 4 flights of stairs to top floor as there was no lift or help from staff The room itself was ok until we noticed CUM STAINS on one of the cushions Yes I m not kidding It was disgusting Breakfast room was very small and had to table share to get seated They served up a child portion of an English breakfast 1 tiny sausage 1 slice of bacon 1 egg and a teaspoon of beans Not worth waiting for Will not be staying again when visiting London 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, When we checked in the 1st night we have been allocated into a single room But we are 2 persons room 207 Can you imagine it We went to the room and it was very small We complained and the receptionist said yes we will changed you into a bigger room tomorrow room G1 When we checked out we asked the receptionist to give us discount only for the first night Because we thought that it was not fair for us to paid double room but we got a single room The person at the receptionist said NO discount We just simply want to be fair 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is supposed to have a 24 hour reception when we arrived at 1 30am after a late arrival of our flight there was no one on reception It was clear someone was around as the computer was on the bag was there but no one in sight We rung the phone the bell I wandered all through the hotel trying to find somebody Eventually almost half an hour later the person who was supposed to be on reception arrived coming down the stairs tucking in his shirt It was clear he must have been having a nap Given I had to get up for work at 7am I was less than thrilled Additionally the sheets on the pull out bed were very stained to the point that they looked dirty The bathroom doesn t have very good ventilation so starts to smell quite quickly The wifi works infrequently The steps to the rooms are very steep and narrow not ideal when you re carrying heavy suitcases The hotel overall is old worn and creaky 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast was too rushed cooked breakfasts were thrust into the table before any fruit or cereal had even been started 
Hotel Cavendish, We got a single and a double room instead of the double and triple that we ve booked No alternative options and a plain sorry is all we got Receptionist was not in a good mood except for the moment when we left 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Reception lounge Reception was left unoccupied with the door open Suitcases left luggage littered the reception lounge should ve been held more securely We didn t leave ours as felt uncomfortable due to the unsecure nature of the room

Hotel Cavendish, Everything they couldn t even provide me with a taxi to the airport Will not book again ever
Hotel Cavendish, There was a raisin on our rug that remained there for the entire duration of our visit despite the room being cleaned every day There was the sound of water dripping all the time 
Hotel Cavendish, WiFi didn t work which was very frustrating since that is how you communicate and find information as a tourist from another country A smell coming from the bathroom 
Hotel Cavendish, We had booked a triple room but this was a double room with sofabed This would have been fine had we been able to use the bathroom when the bed was out Warning about this would have been good 
Hotel Cavendish, The decor is tired there was a queue for breakfast Don t expect anything fancy
Hotel Cavendish, Booked a triple room with double bed Came with two singles Boiling hot temperature in London sun with Windows opening onto scaffolding with no fan or air con The only air con in the hotel was at reception for the staff member 
Hotel Cavendish, Bigger television Better water pressure Triple room had double bed fold out sofa which made room very cramped when folded out
Hotel Cavendish, Definitely NOT 4 star Rooms small but typical of London cleanliness could definitely improve Drains smelled and rooms in need of refurbishment NO LIFT Some reception staff constantly in mobile phone and not helpful Would not stay here again 
Hotel Cavendish, Overcrowded breakfast room tiny room bathroom has seen better days On the continent this would be a two star hotel Friendly staff

Hotel Cavendish, Single room Only space to stand No room for chair Smaller than prison cell Had to sit sideway on toilet because the sink was in the way 
Hotel Cavendish, Noisy road for front bedrooms Locked out of bedroom on the first night and had to sleep in a spare room until joiner called in the morning Unfortunate 
Hotel Cavendish, Actually saw a waitress blow crumbs off a side plate and leave it there for another diner Not impressed Hygeine standards anyone Had to wait for breakfast as room is v small TV in room was also broken shower tiny and opened directly to toilet so no room to dry yourself without hitting said toilet This hotel is adequate for an overnight stay but not exactly the height of luxury
Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small but that is what you get these days for a convenient inner city location The windows were very hard to open and close 
Hotel Cavendish, I know this sounds strange but the only thing we didn t like was the shampoo it had a bad smell We had brought our own so it wasn t a real issue And the wardrobe s top shelf isn t flush with the wall so if you drop something down there you can t retrieve it because the wardrobe is built in the hotel is a bit shabby but not to the point of it mattering The Polish girls were very nice but you have to be very clear when ordering your breakfast be specific or they will bring you whatever they think you want 
Hotel Cavendish, The room is really small There was no hot water in the shower e just little cold water The wifi didn t work well 
Hotel Cavendish, Our room was very tiered and worn out could of done with a revamp also the window sill outside had lots of stubbed out cigarettes on it because the weather was hot we had the window open all we could smell was ashtray description said there was a fan but there wasn t one and no air con
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, room was no bigger than a wardrobe seriously couldnt open a suitcase anywhere except on the bed mould in bathroom thin towels back yard of hotel was overgrown jungle could have been a nice spot to sit if any care had of put into the property no lift
Hotel Cavendish, Shame the garden the hotel looks out on was out of use it would be a real bonus to have some outside space
Hotel Cavendish, A lift would have been good Maybe just a bit too warm in the bedroom but nothing major 
Hotel Cavendish, The aggressive guests outside that kept us awake for several hours in the early early morning by yelling death threats at another guest and attempting to break his door down 
Hotel Cavendish, Apaulling Liquid possibly sewerage started leaking from the ceiling on to our bed from an upstairs room We padded across wet carpets at midnight to an alternative room The shower in the new room was broken We staggered down two flights of stairs stepped across damp carpets to shower in the original room We were begrudgingly offered 25 off the bill for the inconvenience 
Hotel Cavendish, There is water leaking from the ceiling in the room on the last day Besides the staff at the front door is not that friendly and a little biased in certain perspectives 
Hotel Cavendish, The property is really labyrinthine with a lots of narrow corridors and doors and stairs so if you do have weak legs I won t recommend this hotel There wasn t iron in the room we had to carry it from the aisle to the room WiFi worked sometimes and sometimes it didn t worked at all 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was minuscule There was no wardrobe or anyway at all to hang clothes You had to plan your movements within the room and constantly step over things Access to the room was difficult and quite dangerous there were steep curving stairs going down immediately behind a door 
Hotel Cavendish, This could be a good place if they got friendlier people on reception When we turned up reception was open we walked into the room and a man was stood there silently with no shoes on took me a minute to work out he was the receptionist and was about to pray Ok I thought and left the room for a minute but I do think he could have just closed reception for a few minutes to avoid a slightly bizarre arrival Then later on my dad arrived separately he had another booking when he got to his room somebody else s luggage was there in the room The same receptionist at first told my dad to move rooms then said he couldn t because the hotel was full so my dad stayed in the original room the luggage was removed but we were left wondering whether some other people would be joining my dad in the room seeing as they would think their luggage was there All just a bit odd rude and unorganised No apology or any explanation as to why luggage was in somebody s room 
Hotel Cavendish, For 95 a night not that cheap even if central London I was given a tiny cabin room which was basically a single bed with 4 walls around it No space no comfort nowhere to put a suitcase or even a book Possibly larger rooms would have been OK but more expensive again Not well insulated at night could feel the cold draft yet found no extra blanket Wifi didn t work as advertised 
Hotel Cavendish, the room was extremely small and cramped the bed was very uncomfortable the room was noisy with no noise isolation from the street internet did not work in the room however hard the front desk staff tried to reset the router 
Hotel Cavendish, Hotel a bit dingy and in need of an upgrade wifi hit and miss bed not the most comfortable TV remote didn t work safety deposit box didn t work room at the front a bit noisy 
Hotel Cavendish, The walls are thin there is no air conditioning the windows are single glazed there is no way of holding the window open there was scaffolding just outside so I wouldn t want to leave the window open anyway
Hotel Cavendish, It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in I could not fit my suitcase in the room The small single bed was the room There was no desk there More or less impossible to climb all the stairs with a suitcase to get to the room I am surprised and disappointed that booking com even has this hotel as a recommended hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Having booked paid several weeks in advance I wasn t able to get an invoice until I booked out which caused problems with submitting and reclaiming expenses 
Hotel Cavendish, We had a room at the same level with the kitchen and it smelled like a friteuse Tiny bed for a couple it s not a problem for friends it s really little privacy 
Hotel Cavendish, The mattress was very saggy but pillows were good and it was all clean The window was really decayed and coming away from the wall but it had double glazing for the noise and worked but window not to open and close 
Hotel Cavendish, Facilities in room were not working no lift to rooms lots of stairs Room key would not work and was not fixed for two nights we were there Telephone in room not working and no bulbs in bedside lights Very inconvenient having no working key Had to get staff to open door with master key every time we moved out of room 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was small old which I could live with but shower was so slow we couldn t use it Staff didn t seem that bothered couldn t wait to leave 
Hotel Cavendish, Cleanliness in rooms can only get 2 out of 10 points The shower sink was connected with the one used by toilet resulting in a very bad smell had to manually cover the sink with a tea cup and spray up The rooms are very small not more than 2meters in width when on bed my feet were touching the side wall and my head was close to the other wall I am 185cm tall The vent in the bathroom was loud 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast could have started a little earlier 7 30 fairly late for working people 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was really cold the draft through the window was dreadful The radiator took over 2 hours on max to start to get warm I had to wrap my pyjamas around the kettle to get warm and use it to warm my hands too Slept with a jumper and socks on over nightwear 
Hotel Cavendish, when asked for more toast at breakfast told kitchen closed
Hotel Cavendish, No lift my room was at 3rd floor Then room card didn t work and had to call the receptionist to issue another one Mosquitos in room 
Hotel Cavendish, One tiny thing was the shower was weak and underpowered which meant showering was tricky But this was a minor inconvenience 
Hotel Cavendish, Old building in urgent need of redecoration Smelly bathroom though looking new and clean dusty curtains everything needs a coat of paint as a minimum Not suitable for people with luggage tiny room no lift A bit noisy Poor breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, I don t know how this hotel is called a four stars hotel There is no car park then there s no elevator the furniture is very old and uncomfortable at all and when it comes to the breakfast it s very cold with no much of choices It was really very bad experience for us especially with our one month baby and when we had to carry him and our luggage to the third floor There are a lot of negative things to talk about but the only thing I m going to say is that I m not going back here again 
Hotel Cavendish, reception area to small to relax in with a book etc
Hotel Cavendish, The stairs could have been a little longer in length for the footing 
Hotel Cavendish, The rating for this hotel is hugely misleading My room was small and supposed to be a double bed My idea of a double is not two singles pushed together with one higher than the other The mattresses were cheap and uncomfortable The sheets didn t exactly smell fresh The bedside light didn t work Light poured into the room from the hallway through large gaps in the door If the hotel was 50 a night then I wouldn t mind so much but 100 is a complete rip off My email of complaint and follow up were duly ignored Very unprofessional 
Hotel Cavendish, It would be hard to say what we didn t like in only 2 3 sentences This hotel is definitely not a 3 and a half to 4 star as listed Awful 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are advertised as having double beds when in fact the bed was a little more than a single bed what in certain terms would be classified as a superior single room There was no room at all around the bed and it would have been impossible for two people to move around The actual pictures of the room and the physical descriptions have no resemblance to the actual room The room was a single room and highly claustrophobic It s mis selling products to unsuspecting customers who trust your word about the facilities you offer The window had a direct view of Gower Street and it was impossible to open the window due to heavy traffic throughout the night including buses and taxis The shower itself is no bigger than a coffin and I didn t even have a shower The reception staff didn t even bother saying thank you and or asking me how my stay was because he was on the phone when I went down to breakfast and when I came up to leave A grossly exaggerated 2 Hotel masquerading as a 4 facility The only consolation was breakfast and the polite staff in the restaurant and kitchen Overall don t expect a room with a view 
Hotel Cavendish, No lounge facilities or bar Room that we had VERY SMALL Room floor on a slant No chairs to sit on due to the size of the room cracked window which caused a draft Due to the volume of traffic on the street very noisy during the night Overpriced for what you get Would not recommend this hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, Wifi is not good small single room just about 6m2 including tiny shower room 
Hotel Cavendish, Bathroom was cold 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, My bed was next to a single glazed window meaning a constant cold draft was on my back all night Also the WiFi was patchy at best and I couldn t even read my emails efficiently 
Hotel Cavendish, Stayed at this hotel 19 03 for one night My Eurostar was delayed so rescheduled for the following day so needed a hotel room for the night On booking com it rates 4star So i trusted and booked 4 stars i would struggle to give it 2 stars On arrival around 8 30 9pm one lady on the reception and man Very unfriendly people and basically felt i was more of a nuisance wanting to have a room than a guest I asked if they had a double room he just said no this is the only room left A lie i know as rooms available on Booking com but offered no discount for single traveler So i thought ok nice attitude Then breakfast is only from 7 30 9 30 really especially on a Sunday another let down I asked the checkout time and he told me 10 30 but later when checking my confirmation in my room it says 11 00 so another lie he told me I really felt uncomfortable and like i was more of a pain to him than a guest customer On arrival to the room it was so small it was unbelievable i had to have my suitcase in front of the door when i was in the room and then put it on the bed so i could leave the room The whole room was just horrible Shower moldy and hardly worked and im sure they turn the hot water off after a certain time went to have a shower about 9 30 and it was just warm to say the least The breakfast is ok in the morning its free so you cant complain Overall i would never ever stay at this hotel again unless like this time i was desperate but even then i would rather look for something else And as for the man in reception he should either learn to give good service or find a new job your doing the hotel no favors in guest ratings 
Hotel Cavendish, Nothing I can think of 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was useless My room opened onto the courtyard at the back which was pretty but the chubb lock felt insecure Needs a bolt or similar 
Hotel Cavendish, Rooms basic and tired Safe didn t work Over charged 10 
Hotel Cavendish, Room minute and I mean minute shower didn t get hot safe didn t work and the sockets hag arc marks on them which made you very nervous when using them Narrow corridor and fairly noisy
Hotel Cavendish, No Wi Fi as our teeny tiny room was in the basement between the kitchen and the breakfast room We were awaken each morning at 6 30 as the breakfast crewe started unpacking the kitchen for breakfast and they continued until 11 00 It was the worst location for a room possible 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was very small there was no real room to sit and eat One could only watch TV from the bed There was no glass not even a plastic beaker in the room though the receptionist obligingly fetched one 
Hotel Cavendish, For the price it wasn t great rooms small with a very small bathroom Walls thin could hear next door talking around 6 in the morning plug hole in shower making very loud noises Have stayed in alot better Offered to keep bags at hotel on day of departure but not in a safe room just in reception so we declined this offer 
Hotel Cavendish, Upon arrival someone was smoking in the next room The smell was awful along the corridor The reception dealt with the problem immediately and spoke to the guest breaking the rules The smell took a while to disappear which spoiled things a little for me as I hate the smell of cigarettes However the Hotel dealt with the matter swiftly and effectively and for that I m thankful Not really the hotels fault that some guests break the rules
Hotel Cavendish, Not clean very dusty Not proper star rating It was rated 4 stars but actually it is 2 star hotel Very bad wi fi Almost impossible to connect
Hotel Cavendish, The bed was a little bit narrow however it s understable in such a tiny room 
Hotel Cavendish, Tiny room water doesn t heat up very well for shower Oddly decorated looks a bit like an Indian restaurant and it s a bit shabbily done and could do with repainting Also it s single glazed near a train track and poorly insulated between rooms ear plugs are a must but the trains will still wake you up quite a lot 
Hotel Cavendish, Even though the room was double glazed the sound of traffic was bad as hotel on a very busy road there was also a not so nice smell from the bathroom I also asked how to get to the garden as im a smoker but was told the only way to get to it was through a room which was occupied at the time 
Hotel Cavendish, draughty windows bed so close to windows I was cold in bed Bedding inadequate I was in a cabin room alias broom cupboard Curtains non hemmed rags 
Hotel Cavendish, The curtains were torn the breakfast was only English other choices were very limited the bathroom was extremely small The whole hotel looked like two houses put together with as many rooms as possible to make maximum profit 
Hotel Cavendish, I should like to see the garden made into a pleasant place
Hotel Cavendish, The double bed looked a bit like two single beds pushed together Oh well that meant the wife got a good nights sleep 
Hotel Cavendish, No wheelchair access A ramp should be purchased by the owners This is really bad in this day and age I was visiting my daughter who is in a wheelchair and she had to wait outside in the rain while I checked in No excuse for this 
Hotel Cavendish, the rooms on street side are noisy at night breakfast was limited 
Hotel Cavendish, Room very noisey could hear people walking about above constantly dreadful view from window tasteless cheap cups of tea and small breakfast
Hotel Cavendish, Decoration is a little tired and in general the hotel could be cleaner although not really dirty Breakfast was good but dinning room fairly small had to queue on busy day for table when food arrived not as much as the day before when less busy 
Hotel Cavendish, Felt slightly shabby and the creaking doors floors meant it was quite noisy when other guests came in late The toilet had a bad smell 
Hotel Cavendish, nothing at the Hotel but Boris Johnson the Mayor has a real problem with London itself what s it like A dysfunctional building site with no idea on how to treat visitors 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was freezing cold it is still only February not very clean e g someone s hair in the cup on bedroom tea tray very thin duvet no spare blanket and male night receptionist s appearance was grubby wearing a filthy shirt Not welcoming at all Felt very very unsafe 
Hotel Cavendish, Room was small Would have preferred a bath tub instead of a shower 
Hotel Cavendish, Tv never worked fan in toilet never worked shower poor too small windows dont close windows leaking water bed too small for two people Taxi service they use tried to screw us Will not be back there 
Hotel Cavendish, they should landscape the little garden behind the hotel for a pretty view through the windows 
Hotel Cavendish, stayed in room 305 and in heavy rain the roof leaked onto carpet and items on the floor got wet
Hotel Cavendish, I did not receive daily free bottled water while my colleague does 
Hotel Cavendish, The overall hotel is a little tired and perhaps in need of modernisation Certainly the en suite facilities in our room needed updating 
Hotel Cavendish, Nothing
Hotel Cavendish, Room smelled of stale cigarette smoke Was allocated a quiet room at the top of the building which was great until next room used the water which was so noisy it woke me at 11 30pm and 6am 
Hotel Cavendish, We had a dirty towel sewage smell coming from the toilet which then entered the room we were then moved into 2 single rooms even though we had booked a double the breakfast was disgusting me and my mum came down with sickness and diarrhoea from our stay there tried to get a refund for the first evening and was met by very rude and obnoxious receptionists and the manager is yet to phone me to sort it out as now I would like a complete refund as it ruined our trip for my mum s birthday Worst hotel experience of my life 
Hotel Cavendish, Whilst I appreciate that the hotel was making the most of the space it had I didn t appreciate the awful service at breakfast when the dining room was full We weren t even acknowledged as we stood unsure of where to wait while a table became available There was no good morning no apology for the wait nothing When we finally got a table we were told there was no sausage or mushroom left Again there was no apology Shockingly poor customer service and the reason that I would not recommend this hotel It certainly wasn t the start I wanted to my birthday 
Hotel Cavendish, THE ROOMS ARE WAY TOO SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE Increase size of rooms an of breakfast room facilities 
Hotel Cavendish, Didn t feel comfortable as a woman staying on her own Couldn t lock the door from the inside so felt vulnerable Dirty and room not nice for the standard the hotel was advertised to be 
Hotel Cavendish, Hated the fact that the backdoor of the building was in my room and could not be locked It was closed but not locked which was a security risk in my opinion Would never stay here again despite it s good location 
Hotel Cavendish, Bit of a draft in room but it was ok as fresh air but meant noise from street was quite distracting and difficult to sleep 
Hotel Cavendish, Cold room smelly bathroom bad shower could have a sign at the breakfast table to tell what they DO serve as it is hard to understand the fast waitress There as no milk at the breakfast and the bacon came raw Complete the opossite to confortable 
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast starting at 7am would have been better as 7 30am was too late to allow me to catch my train Still appreciated some breakfast items so not too much of an issue 
Hotel Cavendish, Nothing
Hotel Cavendish, There are no lifts so it is ver difficult to manage baggage and only one room is on the ground floor not that accessible if you have mobility issues 
Hotel Cavendish, I had some issues with the internet connection which tended not to be that great at night 
Hotel Cavendish, None Everything just fine 
Hotel Cavendish, To small bedroom and bed for a couple no lift and we was in the 302 last room to tired everyday up and down 
Hotel Cavendish, Lack of space some noise from stairs thin walls 
Hotel Cavendish, The Place is the dirtiest I ever seen the carpet is the oldest dusty everywhere and dirty left from the previous people Bathroom disgusting and the bed not comfortable at all Never again I Left one day before an I only stay because I didn t have way to leave Not recommend to anyone 
Hotel Cavendish, There was not even enough space on the floor to open my suitcase Only narrow stairs I have watched overweight people bumping into the walls me myself did carrying the luggage it was impossible to sit on the toilet you need to sit sideways there is furniture covering a pipe where your leg should be you can hardly move in what they call room it is a cage and definetley not a good offer 
Hotel Cavendish, there is no lift and I was on the third floor Breakfast very basic We had a cracked milk jug on the table at breakfast The staff did not understand most of what we said
Hotel Cavendish, Shower and water stopped working no one let us know So I was halfway through a shower and it cut out Also no iron and ironing board available 
Hotel Cavendish, It was like a house in multioccupation Could hear everything through thin walls Shower was just a dribble Worn and dirty poor quality furnishings
Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny with terrible mildew on the walls The wifi router was on the floor next to my bed The water ran out half way through my shower no water at all Had booked for 4 nights but after the first night checked out in the morning and will never go back 
Hotel Cavendish, drapes carpet etc not as clean as they could be Street facing rooms are quite noisy windows have little insulation 
Hotel Cavendish, If you book a single room check that it is not cabin This means that the room is just wider than outstretched arms The mirror in the bathroom is not over the sink but over the toilet I never got the free wifi to work Although the sheets appeared to be ok the covering over the bed was stained To charge that price for a room like that is shameful 
Hotel Cavendish, Cabin room was really small its not more then just a bed I m not the longest person but i could not sit on the toilet too small Overal cleanliness could be better mold in the shower loads of dust everywhere Bed was clean though
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, First night shower was unacceptably cold Changed room next day Mattress was too firm Felt like sleeping on the floor and I had to leave hotel a day early due to back pain My room was cancelled by mistake and I had to wait until late morning for reinstatement 
Hotel Cavendish, Apathetic staff smallest room in the world Bed is against walls on 3 sides smell of intoxicating fresh paint parts falling off walls and furniture and finally expensive for what it is 
Hotel Cavendish, My shoe box at home is larger than this room and much better looked after The so called curtain was falling down and dirty The wiring of the bed side light was like an NVQ electrical project The shower head has not been cleaned since the hotel opened Luke warm water is being polite disused fans stored on top of the cupboard decoration shocking or lack there of So noisy it was like a night playing in the traffic 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are small and the fabric of the building and its interior is a little tatty The internet is weak emails only 
Hotel Cavendish, The room was run down need painting There was a lot of dust on top of wardrobe 
Hotel Cavendish, Rooms need maintenance Light bulb not working electronic door lock gave trouble on three occasions requiring staff intervention Reception somewhat surly with no interest in guests
Hotel Cavendish, Horrible room located in the basement Very different from the photos in Booking com Labyrinth to find the room and no phone to call reception desk 
Hotel Cavendish, Room too close to breakfast room door do could hear people passing 
Hotel Cavendish, More like a 3 B B in overall standard Cabin Room was like it said on the tin very small but reasonably comfortable 
Hotel Cavendish, room was very small although to be fair it was a cabin room but was tiny It had all I needed though 
Hotel Cavendish, My biggest issue was the back garden was shut off so you couldnt sit outside which i like to do when i stay in a hotel Cavendish Hotels neighbour hotels may have been slightly more expensive but did offer nice gardens Also our heating wasnt on in our room so it was a bit cold 
Hotel Cavendish, Grubby bathroom Flickering light bulb Very thin walls 
Hotel Cavendish, The double bed was 2 singles pushed together and not particularly comfortable The room needed decorating it was shabby The curtain pelmet was covered in dust the windows were filthy and the inner part of the windows didn t shut properly The lamp shades had stains on them I wouldn t put anything in the drawers as they were stained I ve stayed here once before and gave a good review But based on this experience I won t stay again
Hotel Cavendish, Spider web in the room corners stained carpet dirty bathroom very uncomfortable bed no heating central heating wasn t working at all Single glazed window really noisy constant knocking noise all night from central heating pipes from other floors Damp smell moths in the corner of the carpets in the room power sockets are all damaged hot water only comes after running the taps for 3 4 minutes half used shampoo bottle left behind in the bathroom bedside lamp stands broken woken up by breakfast team noise than other guest noises at 7 30am Basement room lg2 should not be sold for money This was definitely a worth 85 a night hotel Next time I will spend that money to get a taxi home Very disappointing Felt ripped off 
Hotel Cavendish, Shower nowhere to rest the shower gels Very Very small english breakfast unsuitable for a man with no extra helpings Small tv 
Hotel Cavendish, not enough seats at breakfast had to wait both mornings sofa bed for child was poor springs sticking up very lumpy no matress protector on bed just a sheet dirty walls black marks on them expensive for the standard it was room was cold no heating on thin bedding scaffolding outside room with sheer drop down no safety bar
Hotel Cavendish, Bit busy at breakfast so a wait for a table one morning 
Hotel Cavendish, Everything The room smelt of damp and sewage The decor was dirty and tired The window almost fell out when i tried to close it as the frame was so rotten The net curtains were black with mold The TV was so small it was difficult to see from the bed Although breakfast was included I was not going to risk eating in such a disgusting place 
Hotel Cavendish, musty smell on arrival everywhere from the entrance to our room on the third floor walls ceilings needed painting dirty carpet dark dingy room dirty shower no matress cover bed matress stained dirty windows and the curtains had seen better days the bedroom carpet was really dirty and there were damp stains on the celing and walls by the windows we didnt feel like stayning at all but it was late and we had an appointment the pictures on booking com looked clean and bright but it was far from it The breakfast foom was very small and we had to wait so long for breakfast on the first morning we went without We did have a light breakfast on the second morning where the very young waitresses were helpful The man on reception on the sunday morning was not interested in my complaints and told us we had to leave by 10 30am when it clearly said 11am on the booking details When i went to pay he told me he had already taken payment by using my card details i didnt think this was usual as it had never happened before My advice would be to not stay here and its not good enough that people see a different view on the booking site we would have thought there should be inspections done on a regular basis to ensure patrons get a fair deal 
Hotel Cavendish, The rooms are very close to each other and not all guests are considerate and let their doors bang wich can be noisy 
Hotel Cavendish, Some staff were more friendly helpful than others I do feel 115 per night was far too expensive for bed breakfast Being in the room by reception did mean it was a bit noisy as you heard everything 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, Hotel is advertising as 4 star However two or even one star is more appropriate The room is so bad that I was thinking about leaving the hotel even it was midnight Decided to stay and have spent a sleepless night in what definitely was the worst hotel I ever visited All this was charged at 100 a night 
Hotel Cavendish, Staff had poor level of English Thin walls TV didn t work properly Internet didn t work properly Price didn t match quality
Hotel Cavendish, No heat during my trip and no Hot water on my second day The staff did not managed to find a solution despite my request The stairs and the building s fa ade were under renovation and the smell of fresh paint was sadly unpleasant I do not recommend this place
Hotel Cavendish, Tiniest room I have ever stayed in had to lug my heavy luggage up 3 flights of stairs without any assistance 
Hotel Cavendish, An incidence of sewer stench occurred while I understand it was coming from the adjacent property it made us feel sick The television fell off the wall The stairway to the below levels could be an incident waiting to happen 
Hotel Cavendish, It s a little small but considering it s central London that s not really a game changer 
Hotel Cavendish, Run down No heating in room En suite smelled and extractor not working Maintenance guy only free after 4 hours Changed rooms and slightly better Probably living off the 5 Cavendish Hotel name 
Hotel Cavendish, The reception guys were very unfriendly the check in started with the payment first every other question the guests should ask after TV was disaster small old didn t work proper because of broken remote control No WI FI on the second floor where our room was The location is not good at all faraway from everything close only to British Museum The room is very small for 3 person There was one king size bed and for the third person sofa with the size of a child definitely not for adult person When the sofa is open no more space for moving inside the room The shower in the bathroom was fixed on the wall but they don t offer shower capes I asked the reception if they can find solution for bigger bed for the third person because we are all adults and one of us should sleep with hanging outside of the bed legs but with smile the reception guys answered to me to search for another hotel 
Hotel Cavendish, The extractor fan in the bathroom was not working and there was a smell There was no heating in the room Staff came but did not rectify the problem we were not offered any alternative or refund
Hotel Cavendish, Premises unrefurbished since Victorian times Reception room in very poor condition EXTREMELY small rooms NO LIFT and many many narrow stairs where you need to drag your heavy luggage In all ridiculusly overpriced and overrated in stars A 2 star max is more likely 
Hotel Cavendish, 4 star is probably incorrect rating No bar restaurant on premises 
Hotel Cavendish, Rooms tired and need redecorating repair moved room 3 times due to drain smell leak when raining and noise by breakfast room during breakfast hours Our best room had no view 
Hotel Cavendish, Couldn t access WiFi Double bed was 2 beds together which would normally be ok except they were slightly different hights 
Hotel Cavendish, the location is close to everything helpful staff nice breakfast
Hotel Cavendish, It was not clean at all They had problems with the heating The rooms were incredibly small
Hotel Cavendish, No shelving so there was limited space to put our things perhaps the telephone coffee table could be replaced by a chest of drawers 
Hotel Cavendish, The roman blind fell on me in the middle of the night and the room had a big problem with bathroom ceiling no lift cabin single room is exactly as the name suggests 
Hotel Cavendish, This hotel was hugely overpriced and lacked many of the basic amenities Bad WiFi tiny room dirty no lift no reception area You can find much better for that price 
Hotel Cavendish, No secure bag deposit An ensuite bedroom that is smaller than my bathroom at home A dangerous bedside lamp that was hidden in the wardrobe and its electrical certificate was out of date No recpetion staff when I left 
Hotel Cavendish, I think the breakfast room is a bit small I didn t get to have breakfast at the first day because the room was full of guests there weren t enough tables to sit in 
Hotel Cavendish, Unhelpful staff 3rd floor room with no lift horrible smell of damp leaking ceiling WiFi not working on path of emergency ambulances from nearby hospital 2 facilities 
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, There is no way this hotel is worth the money I paid for it The room was tiny the decor faded the bed on a tilt In summary a hole I couldn t recommend to anybody It would need to be half the price for this to be value for money 
Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is very shabby the is a smell of damp everywhere and a decided stink of sewage from the bathroom The bed is mediocre the pillows very flat and hard and the floors are dirty 
Hotel Cavendish, Room condition Water marks on room s ceiling and it looked horrible wasn t the kind of room one would expect for a special occasion Breakfast service We ordered white bread and we were told that they ran out of white bread as if it was our fault After that the breakfast service was so slow that we sat there after ordering the food and didn t get our order in time Then there were people queuing up for breakfast so we had to leave without having proper breakfast Housekeeping service When we checked in the room there were 3 bath towels for 3 people but the next day we were only provided with 2 bath towels Housekeeping department never replaced the toiletries for us the next day Reception When I was checking out on 31 08 15 I asked your reception that what is the complain feedback procedure he never asked me what was wrong or if he could help me in anyway I emailed at the address that was given to me but after 2 weeks and I haven t received any response from the hotel or a courtesy call apologising for this horrific experience 
Hotel Cavendish, There was mould and damp all over my bathroom ceiling The shower head was broken And the shower door was broken 
Hotel Cavendish, Mold in the celing in the bathroom Heard rats in the eating area 
Hotel Cavendish, Second night a noise kept going off like a bell until 2am then it stopped then started again at just after 6 am was not happy about that
Hotel Cavendish, The room was tiny it had cracks all over the wall the sofa bed was rock hard so our daughter had to sleep with us the shower and tap was a trickle so it took a while to have a decent shower there was no internet as stated and the TV didn t work 
Hotel Cavendish, A plughole of shower was so bad that overspill water wetted my luggage which was placed in the bedroom There had been no notice about it from the staffs What s more wifi of the bedroom does not work 
Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was horrible tiny single room barely enough room for my suitcase one receptionist didnt give me the time of day other was very nice Very polite breakfast and cleaning staff
Hotel Cavendish,No Negative
Hotel Cavendish, The room was a tiny box with a bed jammed in under the window next to some sort of blind contraption that could not be raised and a window that was jammed open next to the 24 hour racetrack that is Gower Street the traffic isn t the fault of the hotel so did not affect my score The bathroom is tiny and not only was it generally in a dirty condition the previous occupant had thoughtfully left a used feminine hygiene item in the lavatory This proves to me that bathrooms are not cleaned in between occupants There was no water pressure even at 5 am when I decided I couldn t stand it all any longer and got up 
Hotel Cavendish, Wifi was not good tv remote was not working we reported it but it was not sorted Our bedroom window was open when we entered the room my sister went over to look outside and put her hand out to touch the window and there was a sheetrock so she could have fallen out a young child running into the room towards the window would not have been so lucky it was really dangerous We did report it 
Hotel Cavendish, It was really hot and the window wouldn t stay open TV didn t work and when I ask someone to get it looked at they just didn t bother 
Hotel Cavendish, The general condition was poor and outdated Discovering some items not where we left them only to find that they had been placed in our suitcase by the cleaning staff defiantly not happy with this 
Hotel Cavendish, Very small room not suitable for 3 persons Window opened in dangerous way There were scaffolds at the window The room was not clean and had bad smell Not worth the money we paid 
Hotel Cavendish, My error but I forgot to ensure there was a lift We were placed on the third floor six flights of stairs with two pieces of luggage each to pull up the stairs If this does not worry you it is not a problem but for us it was the main disappointment The first staff member who greeted us was very welcoming The other reception guy was not welcoming or helpful Our safe was never unlocked as we requested on the first day Long walk to station so plan to get cab 
Hotel Cavendish, Noise from traffic on Gower Street is constant can disrupt sleep even with the windows closed The single rooms are very small 
Hotel Cavendish, The room needed decorating large cracks in the walls The shower had no pressure The staff in the breakfast area had problems understanding when you wanted something well done When you check in you are given a card which we ticked to pay by cash not card but when check out they had taken the money out of the back on the card we had used to book it with which had no money Which we got charged for
Hotel Cavendish, I booked a single room It said there is wifi access at the room but I totally couldn t access on the second day it had very weak signal you only could access a few minutes then gone the room is so small if you need to upgrade a better single room you need to pay 40 not worth to do so 
Hotel Cavendish, Except location this hotel is not a good place to stay breakfast was poor staff was unprofessional rooms are very narrow and not very clean internet was very weak all equipment bedclothes etc are very old The floors are very weak and make a lot of noise when walk and you can hear any moves of your neighbors 
Hotel Cavendish, Not worth the money of staying here Even though the location on a map seems close it is at least a 15 20 minute walk to anything that is worth seeing or eating There is no elevator and no assistance carrying up luggage The first night the tv froze That morning management said they would switch us to another room to pack our bags and bring them to the lobby When we returned our next room would be available We we returned later that evening our bags were still in the lobby It would have be a decent thing for them to have put our bags in our new room but that didn t happen This room was smaller and on the third night the tv froze again WiFi was if Y Sometimes it would work and others you d have to hold your phone in a particular direction for connection If you are requesting a pull out bed don t It is very uncomfortable If you are going to stay here you might as well book another room so that person doesn t have to sleep on the pull out This place was definitely not worth the stay 
Hotel Cavendish, Not enough seating for everyone at breakfast so we had to come back later

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is not 4 stars just about 3 stars The first night our room was not available we arrived late and clearly the room had been given to someone else The staff was very rude about the situation and not at all helpful The room we had that night was right by the entrance reception overlooking a main road so was very noisy We were moved the next morning to a better room which was clean basic but had no comforts such as tea coffee facilities The bathroom shower floor was not tiled at all so had to shower in flip flops We asked to speak to a manager about our first night and was told the manager only showed up around 11am 12pm for an hour We waited and the manager did not appear Overall this hotel is fine if you want something basic cheaper than central Amsterdam but still walkable into the city centre The local area bars restaurants park etc make it a much better choice
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The finish in the room wasn t great pieces of metal around edging could ve hurt if caught on foot TV wasn t great only had 5 6 clear channels rest were covered in white noises 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Room uncomfortably hot no air conditioning water in shower dangerously hot and could not be regulated We informed Reception staff about these issues on our first morning but no repairs were carried out Our sleep disrupted by fire alarm on one night and on our last night at 4am by a guest thumping on our door yelling and using very offensive language Despite alerting the hotel staff to these issues we had to pay full price emails asking for a refund remain unanswered 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Ground floor rooms were super hot No shampoo in the rooms only 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo which is the same thing as soap Not great for long hair and as a 4 star hotel I think there should be a shampoo just for hair Fire alarm started going at 8 am in the morning Noisy once trams start working early morning
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, There were no tea coffee or mini bar in the room As we booked without breakfast it was not comfortable 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Just to leave a short review of the place During check in the lobby assistant did not get up and handled most of the conversation from her seat 3 meters away from me before finally coming to enter me into the system I took a lower floor on the staff s recommendation for better internet it was still very slow and disconnected often I paid an extra amount for a later checkout because of an afternoon meeting and in sequence the cleaning staff cleaning staff manager and hotel lobby assistant asked me to check out because they did not know despite me repeatedly telling each of them The room wasn t fit for a 3 star hotel how did this place get 4 stars In short this is not the hotel you re looking for 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Booked two rooms one was okay the other had broken AC Wasn t able to get it fixed over the duration of the stay and was only given a small desk fan Made the room unbearably warm Also parking was pretty difficult late night when trying to check in 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning was broken in the first room The second room had broken air conditioning and a window that wouldn t open The final room had broken Air conditioning but a window that tilted outward to let the breeze in and maintain a degree of safety 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The A C wasn t working and it got really hot at night time They didn t have a fan or something and they did nothing to fix the situation 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, There were two remotes in the room 1 I don t know is for what very old 2 for the tv I managed to deduce that from the printings remaining and had drained batteries
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Was not informed that the Aircon wasn t working before arriving it wasn t mentioned when we booked in excuses and apologies not good enough as the temperature was in the high 20s It wasn t fixed during our stay a very basic hotel that doesn t live up to its 4 star rating 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I requested and reserved a room with 2 beds but was given a room with 1 bed Having just been released from hospital I was not up to arguing By the time my husband joined me the next day there were no other rooms available The Wi Fi wasn t working for most of our stay The room was constantly very warm and by the 3rd day the air conditioning in the entire hotel quit working The windows were locked with a key a safety hazard and the front desk was reluctant to unlock them They did finally agree and the room was more tolerable after that I was not given any paperwork itemized bill when I checked out and have requested one by email twice I still have not received it My stay should be covered by travel insurance because of a health emergency but without the billing statement I don t think they will reimburse me for the room or for the mediocre breakfasts we had The price was far more than the accommodations warranted I feel like I was robbed 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air conditioning did nothing to cool the rooms which meant they were very hot when the weather was good We asked for a room with a double bed and got two single beds instead but were moved to a different room on the second day We also booked a single room which turned out to be a tiny loft room with poor lighting a slanted ceiling and exposed beams as well as a very bad bathroom with a concrete floor The cleaning could have been better we saw cobwebs in the corners and dust on surfaces 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Air conditioning not working or fixed for three days we were there the hotel was like an oven Pillows one and one without a cover were awful Bed felt like I was at sea No tea and coffee in the room breakfast was poor range no fresh juice concentrate that had to be watered down No bar or facilities ironing board the size of a child s play thing Some guests arrived same time as me and got a refund and walked out I waited for a lift with my bags and also a family with a buggy We waited for ten minutes and it didn t come so I walked down two flights with heavy bags I was embarrassed that our client guests stayed there with us I walked in first day and the guy behind reception was far more interested in his paperwork than even saying hello If the window shut in your room there was no key to open and I had to find a grumpy housekeeper to open again I felt like I had done something wrong Have you ever watched Fawlty Towers well this place must be the re make of the TV series 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The air con was broken it was 31 degrees that particular weekend there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and you weren t allowed to take the cups upstairs No assistance when asking for help with taxis The lights in the restaurant were always off and no one in the kitchen The room was basically a sweaty little box with a miniature double bed in The towels in the bathroom were ripped The fridge didnt work so we could t keep our own drinks cold 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel ambience property management room bed service breakfast everything is a disaster It is a 2 star hotel Never a 4 star If anybody opting this hotel will be a big disaster and disappointment 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Two rooms and no heating in either I was cold and could not believe this was meant to be a 4 star hotel The price was 4 star though The staff tried very hard to fix the situation so were faultless

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The floor of my room was not very clean and there was a sort of vaguely unpleasant smell that came into the room now and then My room was otherwise fine but the family member traveling with me had to be moved twice before she was put into a room with functioning electricity and phone and she was still very cold all week despite trying to turn up the room temperature The WiFi in my room was okay on my first couple of days but it became more and more spotty until I could not get connected by mid week and my traveling companion never did manage to get connected to it in her room In short it was sad that a staff that truly seems to want to create a pleasant stay for its guests has to work in a facility that is so poorly maintained My travel companion an older family member was unable to sleep until placed into a functioning room on her second night there and I need to try to purse a refund for at least her first night 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The only search parameter I used to find a hotel in Amsterdam was Free WiFi It did not work at the hotel at all So out I go to buy an ethernet adapter to connect to the ethernet outlet in my room Which did not work The hotel all in all is ok but it s year 2017 the WiFi has to work 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This is not a 4 star hotel Small room with no facilities that one would expect in a 4 star hotel More like a 2 star hotel Too expensive for what it offers Breakfast very poor

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Small room in old and not renovated hotel and expensive 156 euros with breakfast per night with city tax included high price for this hotel as well as poor breakfast The hotel charge me twice on the same price before attending into the hotel and after my complain they returned the money back on the master card after some days 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Maybe the space under bed is not a good storage place for broken phones and such on Was expecting a queen size bed but got 2 single beds with wheels The bed sheets could be with better quality if it is a 4 star hotel 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The double bed made of two separate beds and mattresses Not convenient for a couple No water teapot in the room The shower hose was leaking Wi Fi signal is very poor 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The accomodation is not worth the money wifi and the shower didn t work the room was small and with no amenities cheap decorations 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Otherwise simply not good value for the price 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We wanted to stay two nights in Amsterdam Booked Savoy as 4 star hotel Drop our luggage in the room and enjoyed Amsterdam Coming back the room was cold The heater was on but not working In the morning we were completely under cooled My wife is at the moment undergoing Chemo in the Netherlands and was looking forward in a few days away and this really did not help They wanted to offer us a different room but the damage was already made by them Reading other reviews it seams we are not the only once complaining about cold rooms Then the hotel has really an issue Never the less you would thing the hotel would have the decency enough to refund you No management refuses It become even worse Via our credit card they even charged us double and after phoning them they said they could not see it in there system and I should send them proof I don t understand this hotel at all they are in Amsterdam at an ok location but they really mess up business in a big way 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, i didn t stay too long too make a note on anything bad We didn t have breakfast or any drinks in the hotel Only thing I would say is that there was too glasses but no kettle or tea coffee 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Size of the room temperature was a little bit low in winter and I couldn t change it
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, It was freezing during my stay in Amsterdam The room itself was cold ditto for the hot water coming from the taps The AC did not make a dent in the air temp I m surprised for a Savoy hotel and one rated at 4 stars Before I forget the curtains were not full length about a foot missing from the bottom so enough street lighting was able to blaze through 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The toilet is terrible the water turns cold suddenly while showering the room s smell isn t good there was cuts in towels and they don t look that good and the room was noisy someone was knocking on the ceiling from the upstairs 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We booked a twin room with two single beds but the beds were pushed together and we were unable to separate them If we had wanted this we would have booked a double 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, 2 5 stars Worst managed hotel I have ever visited Went for 1 night with 12 o clock check out Got woken by housekeeping at 10am again disturbed at 11am Holes big enough to fit 3 fingers in towels Mattress never been turned sunk in on one side No Do Not Disturb sign or other hotel info in leaflet it was empty Had to ask for wifi info which we struggled to connect to No lotion or anything in bathroom only soap Went to complain and said I had just wasted my money Was then offered a drink at 11am in morning as compensation offered extra hours in room housekeeping maid brought to our room to apologise Was SO embarrassing for us both inappropriate This hotel has NO idea how to deal with customers Please do not waste your money here 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This was supposed to be a 4 hotel The facilities were not great The room was not very clean the carpet was dirty and there was foam sticking out of the walls 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Smelly room 4 stars is misleading has the feel comfort of a 2 star hotel rather If you approach this hotel with the expectation of a 2 star it s pretty OK 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived our booking was not on their list and the staff member said they were full Their internet was down so it looked like we were going to be stuck in the small lounge for the night Although my booking had been confirmed by BOOKING COM weeks ago the hotel had no record of us I should have got suspicious when I had not received an e mail direct from the hotel after booking It was very worrying but after staff contacted the manager who was at a different hotel we were able to be accommodated Don t ask me how if the hotel actually was full 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, dirty floor carpet rosty radiator in bathroom repaired but unpainted ceiling TV was not working prepayment
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Rude staff very slow and weak wifi connection It was very hard to get invoice from reception Finally I got it after whole day calling to the hotel Thanks for the help to booking com support center I will truly not recommend to stay here Please save your money
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This hotel is rated as 4 star but should be 2 star or less Terrible choice and I feel some part deceived as I paid somewhere north of EUR 180 for the night there I do not recommend this hotel Here are some points 1 My room was not clean or at least it felt and looked unclean There were coins on the floor when I arrived and they stayed there the whole trip 2 Towels in the bathroom had dirt spots on them they were also worn and torn The bathroom had a large window in the shower towards the street and beneath the window there was a rusty radiator it did not add to the hygiene level of the room 3 Lights were hanging loose on the fasteners above the bed I was just waiting to get them falling in my head 4 The air condition unit started some loud drumming at 100 decibels or could be even more in the mid night Not able to sleep I complained but the hotel was fully booked and nothing the staff could do When the radiator finally got quiet I ensured it was off for the rest of the stay 5 The bed was a foam rubber mattress far too soft for any regular sized 80 kg weight man to sleep in 6 There was not an option to ask for privacy as no placards signs were available to hang on the door 7 No coffee or any beverages available in the room 8 The TV had only regular TV broadcast stations in bad quality with bad pixels no cable or any HD broadcasting not that I would have enjoyed it in the soft foam mattress bed in the unclean room This hotel is rated as 4 star but that is extremely overrated in my opinion Should be closer to 2 star or even less 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Toiletries very disappointed also no tea maker thought that was poor and only one bedside cabinet for a double room 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was clean but everything looked very very tired The carpet had visible stains and the washbasin had cracks in it the window wouldn t close properly and the light over the desk was leaning against a nearby shelf Around1 30 at night the smoke detector alerted reception of a smoke issue in my room They couldn t call me as we found out the phone in the room was not working so they had to open the door and wake me up After investigation the alarm appeared to have sent a false alarm and it was impossible to reset it The duty staff told me that everything was fine as he would disable the alarm hence I could go back to sleep and he asked me to reduce a little the temperature of the room heating as a precaution against what I had to expressly ask to change my room The following morning reception staff were not puzzled at all by the fact that I had two keys and even after learning of the problem of which they seemed to know nothing none of them thought of apologising for any inconveniences created 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, be caoutioned when you park the car while they will not bring you the car in the hours you need it ask before send your car to parking

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, What didn t we like Everything Where to start We paid 630 on a special deal for 4 nights stay The rooms were small The decor was very worn and old with a cigarette burn mark on one of the covers My towel had a rip in it which tore more when I used it The place smelled of stale cigarettes There was a cigarette burn mark on our bath The lift had a sticky wet patch on the floor in a different place every day from what looked like the bottom of a bin liner There were bleach marks on the carpet by the lift on the second floor which looked like vomit One day our room wasn t made up by the time we got back at 3 30 we were then just given clean towels 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Apart from the reception area everything looked very tired Our bedroom boasted two large windows which was nice but one set of curtains were beautifully ironed while the other set looked as though they had just come out of the washer and were extremely crumpled and creased The bathroom had a strange heater sitting on the windowsill which was very rusty The bedroom fridge bar was empty even though there was a price list in the room a bottle of water would have been very welcome 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, doubled or more the price of the room to 209 excluding breakfast night before a show opened Terrible that happens in the 1st place but the room isn t worth 70 let along 200 Air con leaking water all over the wardrobe and floor shower was rubbish Took 5 mins for any hot water to appear 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, The room was not nice and though it appeared clean it didn t feel clean with stains on the bathroom floor There was a smell of smoke throughout For the price we paid I would expect a lot better worse than a premier inn 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Receptionist didn t think it necessary to acknowledge my presence upon arrival Bathroom quite worn Toilet not cleaned properly Acceptable for one night at a discounted rate but definitely not ok for the usual price or a longer stay 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This could be a boutique hotel but it is so poor that it hardly deserves one star Definitely not 4 stars as listed The worst thing is the smoking Althogh it is announced and postered a non smoking hotel and in the lift there is a warning of a Euro 250 penalty for smoking or using drugs in the rooms or public area the hotel smells of smoke mostly pot The room was smelly and our sheer luck was the good weather that enabled us to open the window especially at night during the day we were out and had to close the window The roof of the second floor next to our window serves as a smoking area and cigarette butts are all around What about the declared penalty The room itself was okay Small it is Amsterdam but convenient and quite clean But But Why do the mangement dish out old much used towels some of which are thorn Why they keep a broken waterfall type showerhead If the magnifying glass was stolen or broke down if not replacing it at least they should remove the bar holding that glass Arriving to the room late at night revealed that 2 light bulbs out of 3 over the desk were burnt The single receptionist had no spare bulbs We managed Did we have a choIce But Again but The aircondtioner had no gaz so instead of cooling the room over 27C hot air was coming out of the vents and we had to shut it down In the morning we were promised that it will be fixed But it was not So we enjoyed another warm night Can one imagine a hotel room with no information whatsoever about the services of the hotel what to do some tourism material Besides a tiny note with one word in Dutch and a drawing of Non Smoking there was nothing Luckily on the telephone one could see the name of the hotel Savoy otherwise one would not know in which hotel he she stays What a pity

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Chek in starts at 14 00 We were there at 14 37 and yet the room was not ready Receptionist offered us to wait another 10 minutes I had to re claim the room after 10 minutes again because it becomes painful to wait for the room after 5 hours of train We re given a room with a thick layer of dust on the nightstand and the phone dirty blankets Also the sink was cracked and the water dripped on the floor through the hole in it One of the bed controls did not work as well It took me 10 minutes of intense conversation with administrator to get aother room Then another 20 minutes till that room would be ready We moved to the other room only at 15 40 Another room was clean though Nobody ever apologized And all that cost me and my friend 150 euros for two days and one night The hotel has a 4 star rating but to us it rather has just one star

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, We booked 2 separate rooms at Savoy Hotel Amsterdam costing around 1000 euros total and each room was infested with bed bugs We confronted the staff on the first of our two night stay and were ignored Upon checkout we showed the staff dozens of bites on several members of our group The staff then took 1 breakfast worth 15 Euro off of our bill Awful service We will not be using this method of booking again and most certainly will not be staying at Savoy Hotel on our next visit 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Staff should handle customer document during checked in time one by one to avoid confusion I travelled with my spouse and my sister decided to stay in different rooms During arrival my sister and I go to the reception counter together just to ask if we can get room next to each other After that the staff took both of our passports to proceed for the documentation at the same time My sister booked room for 4 nights i booked room for 2 nights only As result the staff mistaken which one is us since we had same surname Keep on mistakenly gave me my sister s document credit card receipt to sign and vice versa And later on next day when my spouse and I decided to add on one more night stay the reception staff found out that her colleagues who handle our checked in the previous day had made mistakes by double charged my credit card she reported to her manager and he come to see us and apologize He explain and sort out the issue During our checked out time also the staffs 2 ladies do some mistake at my credit card charged extra charged Lucky my spouse checked one by one the amount stated in the invoice and realized there s a mistake However the staffs had done an excellent job on handling those mistakes And the overcharged amount had been credited back to me on the same day

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived we was told we had to pay a 75 deposit Which We wasn t made aware of when we booked the customer service was pretty poor as we questioned why we had to pay this when we wasn t made aware and all we got told was every hotel in Amsterdam charges it which isn t true as we stayed at easy hotel last year and wasn t charged this We had also booked a double bed and when we got into the room it was 2 singles But the man on reception did move us Also we paid for 40 euros to have breakfast for 2 mornings but when we come down in the morning there was no one in the restaurant so we was looking about for the breakfast as we was told they serve English breakfast but then we see 4 stone cold boiled eggs Beans with a thick skin on them where there been sitting there for hours some dried out scrambled egg and burnt bacon all left under some Heater on the side There was also cereal and some fruit Quite frankly I wasn t eating that or paying 40 it looked disgusting so I got my money back wouldnt say this hotel is 4 star

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Very small rooms No toiletries at rooms No tea and coffee making facilities at rooms No bath robe no AC no enough space lobby or lounge
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, This property is a fraud for the following reasons In reality this is zero star property while they advertise themselves with four stars Health inspection should review this property as in MHO it should be sanitised before use Room they offered us is in the basement and it rather looks like some kind of interigation room in bed Walt Disney movie I am not sure how are they allowed to use name Savoy but I guess no authority is controlling this Overall I strongly recommend bench in the nearby park rather than stay in this facility

Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I asked for a large bed instead of twin bed put together but it wasn t a big issue the room was very nice to relax on 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Single room with bathroom is a size of my bathroom Total around 10sqm max Child size bed no place to stretch your bones It s a monk cell Bathroom no tiles on the floor but some weird mat all old Avoid 3rd floor cells that attic and it s shared roof So people smoking joints there and blowing it trough your open window when summer 
Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, I arrived late due to luggage delay transit flight problem I walked from the tram stop to the hotel 10 minutes in the pouring rain and was soaking wet Despite this the person at the reception made me wait standing for about 10 so he could locate and print the receipt before he even started preparing the room key He finally handed me the key saying that this was the only room available 206 The room was small max 3 x 4 meters and the king size double bed also very small one and half size at the most aproximately 2 x 1 3 meters The room did not appear to have been made before occupation The lights by the bed were not working There were no toiletries later provided and a radiator by the bath tub had rusty connections Wireless Internet was slow stopping and not satisfactory

The Tophams Hotel, On arrival my friend and I thought that the lady on the reception at that time rushed us and did not explain matters to us very well Before we had got really into the reception she was asking for my credit card for the purposes of the mini bar I said that we did not require this but she said that this 25 would be credited to us at the end of our visit I feel that we should have been given the choice and not just told that we had to pay this 25 up front 
The Tophams Hotel, I booked two rooms with twin beds On arrival only rooms available with double bed and a camping bed Rooms were small and filled with too much furniture Beds were uncomfortable One of the camping beds was broken and I had it replaced There were more customers complaining at the reception Lift was out of order temporarily The Hotel didn t want to give the booking com extras such as late checkout

The Tophams Hotel, The hotel is in dire need of decoration and updating Lift not working rubbish bags in corridor Air con not working All plumbing needs sorting as no hot water then no cold water Carpets filthy and pictures missing off the walls so just holes in the plaster and that was the bar area We paid 185 for a room with no breakfast worth 50 at most 
The Tophams Hotel, lighting poor bulbs blown and the damaged headboard looks like something from a 60 s porn movie

The Tophams Hotel, Please do not book this hotel Photos are not accurate made with filter or photoshop reality is different Room bathroom filthy Day staff horrible not much to choose from for breakfast I paid a lot for full english breakfast and if I didn t ask for it we wouldn t even get it Organisation skills 0 Also you get woken up by squeaky floor Book hotel 15 minutes by train from city center and get a nice hotel for this amount of money I didn t know that I would have the option to add photos so you would believe all I have to say 
The Tophams Hotel, The day receptionist could ve smiled more He does not seem accommodating I asked for an ironing facilities as there was none in the room and I have to chase it up after 1 1 2 hours 
The Tophams Hotel, Nothing at all the hotel is very poor and over priced when we got to the room we were shocked they sent us to unprepared room and there was no bedding no sheets or covers consequently the matters was revealing so dirty lamps were broken no DND sign safe is not working unless if we request a key from reception no lock for bathroom door moreover the lift was not working finally they have charged me twice
The Tophams Hotel, Space and distribution of the room staff is nice but take a long time to check in and the cost is super high comparing to the conditions of the room 
The Tophams Hotel, The room was poorly laid out The temperature of the hot water in the shower was hard to control When it seemed to be right it would go cold for short periods 
The Tophams Hotel, Very small room not unexpected for London incredibly hot despite no obvious radiator in the room the bath had recently been sealed but there is orange mould on the blind in the bathroom yuk 
The Tophams Hotel, The bed was awful the most uncortable thing I ve ever slept it The bathroom didn t have a lightbulb I asked to have it changed three times and still wasn t done 
The Tophams Hotel, The receptionist is not really friendly to me Every day i saw guests argue with the receptionist over things They just don t seem to be helpful at all The lift was broken the entire time i was there so have to climb floors everyday The room is spacious but not very clean The floor is so thin that you can basically hear everything your neighbors do especially at night The mattress is the worst and you can actually feel the springs inside in Won t recommend for a long stay 
The Tophams Hotel, Not cleaned well burned through holes in bed covered with a pillow the tv remote control was covered in stains and dirt I accidently got some crumbles on the floor next to bed on my first night and throughout 5 nights of my stay they didn t get cleaned vacuumed away imagine what else is on that carpet from previous guests 
The Tophams Hotel, I have used this hotel on and off since 1997 It used to be privately owned and was very nice but a little run down 8 or 10 year ago it was closed for 2 years and totally refurbished It is now getting ready to be done again as the degree of footfall is starting to show door to wardrobe broken dirty tile grout in bathroom table tops scratched and devoid of paint tea coffee not replenished for second night etc This is a nice hotel in a great location with a bit more thought on the part of the management it could be one of the best and best value in that area 
The Tophams Hotel, The WiFi did not work that well in the room 
The Tophams Hotel, The room was not cleaned as well as it could have been skirting boards and light fittings need dusting too And just a regular coat of emulsion would make so much difference to what should be a lovely cosy hotel 
The Tophams Hotel, Had booked a double room at the hotel and was told on arrival there was only a singe bed room in a different location Was left with no choice I was told double rooms were fully booked Room and standard of property was very poor Shower room was terrible Would not recommend anybody to stay here unless you are given a room in the hotel They compensated me with full breakfast 
The Tophams Hotel, Stayed in Mews 3 No heating in bathroom area and paint was flaking off of ceiling and walls Only stayed one night so no opportunity to complain at time Would not stay again 
The Tophams Hotel, The beds could be more comfortable you could feel the springs in them 
The Tophams Hotel, The room was dirty the headboard was peeling and there were some stains on the walls The bath had no plug there was no iron in the room when there was meant to be and the blind in the bathroom was mouldy and disgusting The mattress was absolutely horrendous it was so old and soft that we both had to climb out of it in the morning 
The Tophams Hotel, This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel but this was one of my worst experiences ever The room appliances shower etc were totally outdated smelly some things not working The room I was assigned was missing a TV A hanger for the TV was there but the TV was missing I changed then to another room The room had not even place for a chair and was missing basics that even a hostel has as a hook to hang something or a lights switch near bed or a light close to the bed The shared shower had only cold water the tap was falling down and this had nothing to do with me not knowing how to use it rude excuse from the reception Internet too slow to check even and email Very bad breakfast for a 4 start hotel no real juice very few choices I was offered to pay an extra on top of the extra breakfast cost to get something warm The plugs are old and unlike other international hotels do not fit EU plugs without an UK adapter Personal at the reception has bad manners and is not trained Avoid this place by all means 
The Tophams Hotel, it was very cold as we were on the bottom floor and the room took a long time to even heat up a little there were heaters provided but it still took a while
The Tophams Hotel, Have to say that the water pressure for the shower was non existent and that was a particularly cold little cave 
The Tophams Hotel, Cold shower Very warm room No ventilation Very Noisy air con so had to leave off room next to lift so could hear lift at night mould on blind in shower dark bad lighting in shower broken tiles in shower lumpy bed cooked breakfast not piping hot 
The Tophams Hotel, The fact I was told given my booking there was no more rooms then suddenly pay extra 150 and one was found The whole experience left me feeling mislead and ripped off I will not recommend or return as a customer 
The Tophams Hotel, staff didn t really want to help when we asked for an extra pillow it seemed like a big deal and they did not believe I was British at first and demanded to see my passport which I didn t have 
The Tophams Hotel, The room was dated dirty and tiny It wasn t what I had booked A member of staff unlocked my door with guests with them at midnight and tried to enter my room whilst I was sleeping I complained and they haven t done a thing about it disgusted Will never stay here again 
The Tophams Hotel, Hotel was run down and reception was medieval Receptionist was slow and they wanted the money for the room when we arrived before we had time to see the room Walls were dirty and shower was peeling away at the ceiling Headboards were scratched Not a wide selection of teas for tea and coffee and room was cold I don t think the room or the stay was worth 205 for one night 
The Tophams Hotel, When you first walk into the lobby it looks nice and cozy but once you get into the room that s were you get very disappointed The rooms are way over due for renovation The walls have nasty staines and scratches The comfortater looked like it hasn t been washed in ages Blanket had red stains on it gross I should have taken pictures to post it here But you ll see for yourself if you happen to stay there Shower was all rusty and splashed water all over the place TV remote was broken and TV itself had very poor signal almost impossible to watch But the most disturbing part was the mini bar It had the bottle of sparkling water with broken seal on it refilled with tap water They claim to be the 4 star hotel It s a lie I would barely give them 2 
The Tophams Hotel, The English cooked breakfast was probably the worst I have had I asked to cancel the breakfast for the rest of the week and they said they could not do this I wouldn t call this a four star hotel

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, our room was very small and didn t have a window it wa also extremely noisy in the morning as we were right next to the cafe area not a great deal of choice for breakfast
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, When we arrived to check in we were asked to take a seat in the coffee shop for 5 minutes the two girls were chatting and laughing at the reception whilst we waited after 5 minutes we asked again to check in when we arrived in our room there was a guy with his head under the bathroom sink and a toolbox Tiny room could just about manouvre around the bed managed to iron hence blocking entrance to bathroom room exit

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The area was very poor And room was also scruffy with black markings all over the walls 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Windowless room was a disappointment It wouldn t have been asuch of a problem if it otherwise resembled the pictures of the standard double rooms but it was tiny and I could hear all of the noises from the coffee shop upstairs including water running through pipes There was an odd locked door in my room as well that had light coming from all sides through the night Not the worst place to sleep but not a place where you could rest and hang out 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, a bit noisy from the street 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The hotel itself you had to enter through a cafe that was unclearly marked in an extremely unwelcoming unattractive area which was also opposite a building site The staff were blunt and too busy serving coffee or looking busy than checking us in The breakfast was an abomination serving cheap value cereal bars a few sad hard boiled eggs left on a plate cold and some stale brioche I would t even call it continental just appalling and not worth the money in the slightest I could have bought the whole of the cheap Tesco selection myself The room itself was topped it off by the broken sink and tiles surrounding the basin dirty scuffed shower plate and the sink did not drain properly The walk too the zoo was around 35 40 minutes and the connections a pain for the main tube stations The money for the compact rooms shoddy street and disgusting breakfast is not one I will EVER choose to do again 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The ceiling in the shower cubicle needs to be fixed it was very stained and off putting Although I appreciate that the windows could be opened they also needed to have an extra level of glazing as it was very noisy There was no extra space in the room about a foot between end of bed and wall opening the wardrobe meant that the room was full

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Breakfast was very poor If u like boiled eggs salami cheese peppers with bread toast or mini chocolate chip muffins then you will be fine I don t mind a continental breakfast but a croissant or pain au chocolate would have been nice I know traffic noise can t always be helped especially in London but the constant police sirens and the sound of the pedestrian crossing all night really didn t aid a good nights sleep 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, This hotel is located in a very unpleasant area as a young couple we felt really unsafe in this area due to the amount of people fighting on the streets and police vans just outside the hotel Staff representatives smoking outside the front door After travelling from Newcastle checking in our bags then being told to come back and check in my partner and I received a phone call telling us our room had been cancelled due to overbooking on their end and we did not have a room to stay at for the 2 nights we were in London As 18 year olds miles away from home This had me very distressed and upset and I had to get my parents to call to get our room back The customer service from the reception team was appalling unprofessional attitude and very un friendly They could not have been bothered if they tried no manager to speak to on site either Very disorganised Bed sheets and walls had marks on them and the bed was tiny We were offered complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience they had caused This itself was very dissatisfactory small selection of pastries cereal and some ham and cheese Safe to say I will never be returning or recommending this hotel to anyone worst stay I have ever had Highly disappointed I have wasted my money on this

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The rooms were ridiculously tiny the dressing table was damaged so kept catching leg as you tried to squeeze past the tiniest gap between that and the bed The entrance is via a coffee shop type set up so not pleasant When we first got there they gave us a basement room well box with NO windows is that even legal surely this is a fire and safety hazard I was so claustrophobic and me and my 6ft1 fianc e had to constantly bump into eachother just to move about Both our feet hung out the bottom of the bed I have stayed in MANY hotels and this by far is the worst I have EVER been to Rip off and the staff are unhelpful and rude While we tried to check out and tell them of our awful experience she took a phone call and took so long we walked out My personal info and licence were left on the reception for everyone to see so I took these with me Horrendous hotel

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, A room without a window is called a cupboard It should not even be legal and definitely not called a 4 stars hotel And when there is written on the booking description that the room has a view not having a window is a consumer fraud Eventually when a hotel mistakenly charges GBP 267 instead of 297 one can expect the customer to be informed that a mistake was made and that an additional GBP 30 will be charged before the additional charging happens

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Extremely hot in room 002 with no window Had to leave the key card in the slot 24 7 to keep the air con Working or it became unbearably hot to the point where I had to take a cold shower in the middle of the night I was woken up by a staff member coming into my room at midnight as I lay sleeping naked due to heat I was not impressed All sorts of noise kept me awake from there on in a water heater noise kept recurring for the best part of the night After finally falling asleep after a very disrupted night I was horrified to be woken up by drilling on the other side of my wall at 9am With no warning or mention of the disturbance I was beside myself with frustration I stayed for two nights over the weekend and thought that maybe the Sunday morning would be a little quieter and time for some rest after going out late on Saturday night wrong Once again hammering and drilling first thing Sunday morning I couldn t wait to get back home to Devon for some rest I will never stay at this hotel again and I advise you to be very cautious when considering this hotel

Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Room very hot due to problems with air conditioning Misunderstanding about booking but was resolved eventually
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, The booking format does not make it clear that there are breakfast options and only makes the full breakfast option available 
Best Western Maitrise Hotel Edgware Road, Lots of things went wrong I did not like how the toilet roll bracket came off the wall I did not like how the shower fitting was unstable and at a diagonal angle I did not like how the curtain rail fell of the wall when the curtain was drawn back The bedside cabinet came apart when I moved it slightly to get my phone charger But above all these points the air conditioning wasn t working so it was incredibly hot during the night and with Paddington police station opposite made for an impossible night s sleep

Commodore Hotel, Had few hours without water But again I was informed that they had issues with water pipes that were working on it

Commodore Hotel, The air conditioning was broken no wifi in our room the bin wasn t emptied for days and tea and coffee wasn t replenished 
Commodore Hotel, Checkin time was not before 14 00 which I had not seen advertised Had I known I would have changed my arrival plans Staff seemed less friendly than I would have liked Breakfast was disorganised You should not put a sign at the dining room entrance which says Please wait to be seated or some such message and have no staff to greet you I waited a few minutes then chose a seat myself and advised several other confused groups of guests to do the same 
Commodore Hotel, The room was pokey smelt of food from the kitchen close by it was noisy all night because of a generator type noise and we were in the basement it felt like we were in a cell with no natural light Can t believe I paid 200 for such a crap room We stayed in a Best Western the week before and paid 100 and it was amazing in comparison 
Commodore Hotel, Room 45 had the feeling of being seldom used it felt a bit like we ll make this half landing area into a room for occasional use if we really need it 
Commodore Hotel, When I first arrived the male attendant was not very friendly I was given a very poor room and the air conditioning was not working and I could not open the blind to let light in The male attendant was not happy that i complained and reluctantly shifted me to a satisfactory room The female attendant the next day was delightful and helpful and reassured me that I could indeed stay in the better room 
Commodore Hotel, The shower curtain was dirty for 4 of 5 days we stayed one of the elevators was broken had to take the one on the other side of the floor and they were extremely slow The staff didn t speak English that cleaned our room so when they came I m and we were still there we couldn t communicate that we just wanted the bathroom cleaned or when they could come back they just back out of the room saying sorry 
Commodore Hotel, Needs refurbishment d cor was old fashioned bed wasn t particularly comfortable but I have a bad back anyway so sleeping can be difficult in a strange bed No bar or restaurant at the hotel 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms aren t very large my AC did not work and I asked several times for this to be fixed 
Commodore Hotel, Rooms were small and outdated Sheets were very rough 
Commodore Hotel, I had to pay an extra 50 security deposit as well as my payment in full on check in which was unnecessary As usual poor coffee in room Hot reception
Commodore Hotel, Stained and worn carpets Small space Too many doors in room took up more space than necessary making it even smaller 
Commodore Hotel, Room not made up 6night stay water pressure bad Toilet would not flush door to bathroom jammed Air con did not function Cigarette butts all over entrance 
Commodore Hotel, This hotel is British so I would not recommend it to someone who is accustomed to the comforts of American hotels If you want an American style hotel I recommend that you first investigate chains like Hilton or Marriott in London 
Commodore Hotel, Furniture is in a bad condition and old Air conditioning was not working for the last two days Water leaking at room 306 from the room above it TV was out of use as all channels were not clear Housekeeping staff don t speak English Breakfast can t be included with the the rate Corridors are narrow 2 people can t pass through at the same time Lift is too small to occupy one person with one piece of luggage of normal size
Commodore Hotel, 1 We received the wrong rooms not those reserved 2 We received used rooms with used sheets and used towels the cleaner did not clean the room 3 The air condition did not work and maintenance refuesd to fix it couldn t sleep at night was to hot 4 Sercive was he worst i ever experienced we asked to talk to manager but he was never there and when the manager received our complaints he ignored we felt like the hotel crew waited that just leave
Commodore Hotel, Nothing Unhelpful and rude staff The room was a disgrace It was filthy threadbare carpets cracked sink mold on the ceilings gaffa tape along the bottom of the shower screen bottom bit of the bathroom door missing Aircon very noisy and didn t cool the room just pumped out dust Squatting would have been more comfortable Do not stay here 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, The room was small The carpets a bit shabby No bar You had to pay extra for breakfast biggest complaint is after using booking com for 12 years this is the first time we have ever had to give a 50 pound deposit When we settled the next morning it should have been deducted from the bill and it wasn t Will have to complain to booking com Disgraceful 
Commodore Hotel, Unfortunately we were on the ground floor right next to a slamming door this was slamming constant from around 6am onwards and you could hear people from above but I always travel with earplugs would request a better room location next time
Commodore Hotel, The rooms and corridors need seriously updating there were stains on the carpets and they were also threadbare patched up plaster on walls taps loose in the bathroom towel warmer was chipped off and rusting and air conditioner did not work very poor for a very hot night when we d spent 170 for the room for one night Not good enough 
Commodore Hotel, We stayed on the 06 Floor and this was very tired carpets and decor also the room was very basic for 155 total cost the location was great and the exterior of the property lovely 
Commodore Hotel, Where do we begin Room Far to small for twin beds Very hot and clostophobic Thread bare and loose carpets Worn bathroom fittings Decor in need of total referb
Commodore Hotel, The hotel is now very worn and old not in a good way I used to stay here a few years ago and quite liked it but problems with bookings meant i switched to other properties when in London the place feels disorganised my booking had been mixed up and I couldn t get the room i had booked I was given another room which already had other peoples luggage in it Staff did not seem to understand why such things are annoying When I eventually spoke to the manager he was very good and promised to rectify things for future trips but there was no practical solution offered I did get the suite I had booked on a my second night but my 2nd evening was busy with work and I only got to use it for 6 hours before checking out for the airport All in all very disappointing 
Commodore Hotel, The walls were paper thin and we could hear the Neighbours talking Also to close the room doors people really needed to slam the door which was very annoying after 9pm having the room shake during this process wasn t fun 
Commodore Hotel, Decour was very dated and in need of a good paint as paint was peeling in the hallway and bedroom Bed wasn t very comfortable 
Commodore Hotel, There is no bar or restaurant and limited room service but there is plenty of places 1 1 2 blocks away 
Commodore Hotel, Let me start by saying I booked months ago and am now 33 weeks pregnant Asked specifically for a twin room on either floor When I arrived at the hotel on Friday 30th June the reception was frozey the receptionist wouldn t make eye contact no how are you no welcome just can I have your credit card with no explanationation on what for I asked and eventfully she said to take full payment no option to pay with another card just hurry up and hand over the card I paid the amount in full put my card away and then was asked for it again for a 100 security deposit which would be released in 5 working days The lady receptionist literally couldn t care less that I was struggling with bags and having to rumble around for this card I was told we had been upgraded into an apartment with no option to stay in the hotel I booked the hotel wanting a twin room as I am up and down all night and this is not fair on my husband We were lend to this apartment 41 5mins walk down the road apparently No help with bags nothing just running after the porter We get to this apartment with 2 guys sitting on the step smoking and drunk opened the door to be told you have 4 flights of stairs at this point I had enough I said you are joking why can I not be put into the hotel I was told because they had over booked and I had no option Porter started to climb the stairs and I said will you help please He tutted and took my bags I struggled with the stairs this is way too much for me personally The apartment was dated smelt of musk and dirty The sofa cushions with covered in a white liquid I dare ask The fridge stunk of old meat The sofa bed had no duvet for my poor husband The shower room had a white mildew in the corner My main bedroom was fine the bed was small but ok The bathroom was dirty again full of hair and marks I called the reception to be told that no management worked the weekend and to email the issues I did this Friday no answer as 
Commodore Hotel, It was very noisy at night the constant creaking of the property kept us up The bed was incredibly uncomfortable Probably one of the worst night sleeps ive had and i can normally sleep through anyghing 
Commodore Hotel, The check in staff were terrible we waited an hour after the check in time and one of our rooms still wasn t ready when we complained about the time it had taken we were told it was our fault for changing from a room we hadn t even booked in the first place No one seemed to have a clue what they were doing Then after waiting all that time we were finally told we could get into one of the rooms or could leave our bags behind the desk for later Terrible service unfortunately as the hotel was nice 
Commodore Hotel, Upgraded to appartment had to check out after first night which messed up our plans as was told couldn t stay in same room for full 2 days Also no bedding provided for sofa bed for second person so cold and uncomfortable sleep On return to the hotel at midnight put back in same room appartment had no been cleaned no coffee replenished Staff very unhelpful Not the service I expected for 315 for 2 nights
Commodore Hotel, Terrible room in the basement Minimal natural light Felt like we slept in a cleaners cupboard The beds were on wheels so every time you lay down you moved half a metre across the room The bathroom was tiny to sit on the toilet meant you had one leg in the shower Not impressed 
Commodore Hotel, Entrance to the room was awkward could hardly get in with big suitcase Closet for clothing also contained the mini fridge which when closed became warm My suits felt like they had been in a hot air dryer Three consecutive nights but each with a different price night 2 10 Pound night 3 40 Pound remarkable 
Commodore Hotel, The room was incredibly small not like the photos no lift no bar shower room extremely small could hardly shut the door when using the toilet the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in for the money extremely disappointing I won t be coming back 
Commodore Hotel, The carpets in our room were in need of a good clean the carpets and floorboards throughout the second floor should be replaced due to the uneven and creaking sounds when walking to the lift the walls needed redecorating the hotel was advertised as a 4 it is definitely not I would not give it a 2 we were also asked to pay a 50 deposit for the mini bar which did not have any alcohol in at all 
Commodore Hotel, The room provided was damp and smelled musty The carpet was beyond worn and looked filthy I did not witness renovations to these accommodations as stated by the property manager online from a May post 
Commodore Hotel, The staff are very unfriendly The rooms are dirty and extremely warn The rooms look nothing like the pictures on the internet which is very deceiving 
Commodore Hotel, It could have been cleaner 
Commodore Hotel, The facilities are very outdated For a four star hotel I expected it to be in better shape The floors are in serious need of replacement The wifi wasn t very strong but worked okay At first we were in a basement room that has a dead cockroach and were moved upstairs to a much nicer room Though again the floors were not great and came off in your socks Also the maids did not refill all items each day or take away dirty dishes 
Commodore Hotel, When the aircon didn t work and I was given a room in the basement It looks fancier but it s not a room I would choose to sleep in 
Commodore Hotel, Having to pay a deposit was abit much if a deposit was needed it should be paid back on departure of the hotel 
Commodore Hotel, this hotel is not 4 star the carpet in bedroom was thread bare and the room very small paintwork chipped and in need clean hall way outside room was dirty and although it had patio door onto roof top this was dirty and we had duck nesting in plant pot on the patio
Commodore Hotel, on arrival would have nice to have some milk and bread we took our own tea and coffee 
Commodore Hotel, The location is a bit hard to find without navigation The fitness center was old and dingy mold smell and I would never use it 
Commodore Hotel, A few afternoons were very warm in the room and when there was a breeze it was comfortable However on a couple of days it was quite warm but the A C did not work It appeared that the units were on a timer since they did not function during certain parts of the afternoon the thermostat was locked out but the fan still worked This occurred in each of the rooms in which we stayed We did bring this to the attention of the front desk the first day it occurred but they were not able to adjust the thermostat either It did work later during the following afternoon 
Commodore Hotel, We were given the most dreadful room at the top of the hotel outside the laundry cupboard devoid of any decorative features or comfort It felt like the servants quarters in a town house Having stayed here several times before I know there are nicer rooms so we complained and were allocated another room but it was pretty basic The glamour of the entrance hall certainly doesn t run through the hotel The carpet outside our room was totally threadbare The electricity kept cutting out There is a line between shabby chic and downright scruffy and I m afraid that whilst this hotel used to be the former it has become the latter 
Commodore Hotel, I didnt like anything about this hotel complete disappoinent the room the hotel and all the facility was not anything like the information online I tried to book other places despite the fact that i have already paid for the hotel as i was let down badly but unfortunatley it was too late to find any other hotels I dont know how this hotel got 4 star They only deservd 1 star 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Extremely tiny chambers Extremely narrow corridor to access the rooms The furniture and design is from pre Victorian era 
Commodore Hotel, Got a room in the basement It smelled bad I believe due to the humidity and lack of light Matress was horrible Found a big bug on the floor We were moved to a better room after a complaint Room was way better 
Commodore Hotel, Air conditioning didn t work in either room they put me in Got handed off to the next shift and nothing was fixed while we were out and about all day They gave me a small desk fan to compensate never got below about 75 degrees in the room Tiny bathroom about an 8 min walk to Queensway Sub stop Leicester Gate sub stop is closed through July 2017 Not a 4 star experience 
Commodore Hotel, I had requested an early check in because we were flying in from San Francisco arriving at 8a they seemed annoyed at my question which was dissapointing even so it was overall a great stay I would book it again 
Commodore Hotel, A couple of the gentleman at the front desk would benefit from customer service training 
Commodore Hotel, It is a very very very old hotel that needs a complete rennovation Nothing is properly working sewage system is not working it s very dirty 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, The number of stairs no known when booked 99 Staff were very helpful in offering an alternative however the apartment made up for the climb We would go again and stay in the same apartment 
Commodore Hotel, The AC didn t work for the first day discourteous staff and receptionists Didn t match with our rest of the booking com experience at all during this Europe tour It sucked 
Commodore Hotel, The room was in need of refurbishment and re decorating there were many chips in the kitchen sink etc and lots of noise coming from the building next door 
Commodore Hotel, A deposit for the mini bar excuse me this is 2017 In addition this was not refunded to my account upon check out despite reassurances that it would be I do not like staff who lie This is totally unacceptable I still incur charges for this The room was pathetically small My wife and I had to exit the bedroom to allow the other to move around No doubt a necessary but stupidly located fire door within the room itself Requested to give my ID document so a copy could be made This practice must stop It is not a requirement and I have a letter from the Home Office to the effect Wooden floors and elephants in the room above did not allow a good rest Air conditioning did not work properly and the room was stifling 
Commodore Hotel, People on top of us kept walking and it was too noisy all the time sling should have noise prove and solid it was squeaking all the time when people were walking Another think when we came to the hotel after the night out there was Asian Indian looking guy standing outside for smoking right at the entrance of the door with his very ugly night short and half naked it wasn t very pleasant when you have you family with you especially being as Muslim I was very embarrassed to my wife 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Asked for staff to organise a taxi to take us to Paddington Station A non taxi car pulled up and the driver took us to the station and charged us ten pound It would have cost 6 pound in a taxi 
Commodore Hotel, The bed was like a rock Shower and bathroom was leaking Carpet in rooms and hallways needs to be updated 
Commodore Hotel, The first room we were given was very outdated there was a crack in the window and a frame covering a hole in the wall The shower was in a bathtub that was a death trap to get into they had installed a wall along the side to prevent water from getting out and you had to climb in through the slanted back part of the tub Surprised nobody has been injured yet The sink also lacked running hot water However when we shared our concerns with the hotel staff they immediately offered to move us to a more updated room 
Commodore Hotel, Everything Extremely run down rooms windows that don t lock but are easy to open with one finger I didn t like the fact that they charged me 10 hour for my room that was already ready A strange man entered my room with a key whole I was sleeping and the hotel had no explanation but that I should think nothing of it I was nervous to sleep both nights I was there To top it off the front desk man had horrendous body odour I will never go back 
Commodore Hotel, Not like four star Just like one or zore No poor No poor No poor But I saw they have the poor on booking They are liar No worth the price 
Commodore Hotel, Too small and the facility old No worth the price I ll not choose the this hotel again It not like a four star Just worth one or zero No poor The big reason I choose this hotel is that I saw the poor in booking But they don t have don t have don t have 
Commodore Hotel, Room was tiny toilet was downstairs and bathroom upstairs No lift to our room
Commodore Hotel, Perhaps cost of breakfast which we did not partake in as it seemed a little pricey 
Commodore Hotel, There was a restaurant on site but options very limited and most were Indian dishes which is not great if you re not a fan of Indian food There are restaurants nearby however Rooms are quite small but the hotel was pleasant fine for our 2 night stay 
Commodore Hotel, I was given a room at the basement which was too noisy I was told that another room would be available for me the following day but this never happened The wi fi signal was extremely poor Overall during my stay I did not feel like staying in a 4 star hotel and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone Utter disappointment and a waste of money 
Commodore Hotel, Pity there is no bar 
Commodore Hotel, They are doing up the downstairs and could do with continuing the up grade but was quiet good anyway
Commodore Hotel, The welcome from the receptionist could have been a little warmer there seemed too little staff and although we were the only guests checking in at that time she appeared really stressed There was no explanation about the breakfast options no bar available to have a drink and no information available with regards to the local area 
Commodore Hotel, There was a refurbishment going on at this hotel that wasn t advertised we couldn t even get access due to ladders the hotel needs a lot of work Our room was tiny no where to put our suitcase without blocking the door poor d cor light was broken tap in bathroom was broken and bathroom generally poor Single duvet in double duvet cover and bed not even made well polyester pillows rubbish and no extras supplied were supposed to stay 2 nights but checked out after one and didn t get a refund even though we alerted them soon after checking in 100 a night absolute rubbish value for money better off checking into a premier inn 
Commodore Hotel, Staff were a bit offstandish and even though I chose to pay at the hotel on the Saturday the hotel had pre authorised the money since Monday When I got to the hotel they pre authorised another 50 in case of damages and mini bar use This money was also held for several more days after we checked out Although the staff s defence was that it was made clear before we booked it was not I have never encountered this at a hotel before and disliked it very much Also it was not up to the standard you would expect from a 4 star hotel 
Commodore Hotel, VERY POOR ROOMS NEED MAJOTR RE FIT CARPET WHAT CARPET THREAD BARE BATHROOM VERY VERY POOR NEEDS MONEY SPENDING BIG TIME ON ROOMS THEY WERE CLEAN
Commodore Hotel, Very basic room with duct tape holding the carpet down Asked for breakfast to be sent to in the morning at the front desk the previous evening which the receptionist noted down We waited the next day only to be told we should have put a card on our door We called down for ice to have a drink before we went out and having waited over 20 minutes we called down to cancel as we were leaving Hair dryer in the room didn t work so a new one was sent up by the plug on it was broken Called down again and the receptionist said their was nothing he could do as that was the only spare I asked if he could get one from another room and he couldn t Eventually an electrician was sent up to fix the plug The receptionist seemed as if I was asking a lot of him and as if I were making him go out of his way for something which you would expect to be provided in a hotel room Not all the staff were bad and most were helpful and friendly but overall with my experience I would not go back You can get a better room and better service at other hotels for the same price 
Commodore Hotel, Internet was very unreliable in the apartment area Most of the staff were very accommodating However there was one receptionist who was very unhelpful impolite He seemed unhappy to deal with customers inquiries The nearest train station Lancaster was unfortunately closed for renovation The Queensway station is about a 10 min walk from the hotel which can be a chore if you re traveling with heavy luggage 
Commodore Hotel, We didn t have breakfast so could not comment Nothing to dislike 
Commodore Hotel, Hotel while very clean is a little bit dated could do with a good overhaul Carpets were a bit old tatty Bathroom was very small we were upgraded to an executive room I hate to think how small the standard rooms are as ours was quite tight 
Commodore Hotel, On arrival we were told that there was a problem with rooms they did not have the 2 rooms that we had booked I see from Tripadvisor that this has happened to others We were given the option of 3 of us sharing a room not suitable or an upgrade to an apartment in Kensington As it was London marathon weekend we had little option than accept the apartment offered The apartment was very basic smelly noisy We were travelling with a visitor from Switzerland felt very embarrassed annoyed to have to stay in these apartments Would never book the Commodore again We were also charged a 100 room deposit 
Commodore Hotel, 1 The room The carpet is about to come off The cabinet door cannot be opened fully because the bed was blocking it so the drawers could not even be opened 2 The creaky ceilings IT WAS SO LOUD On the very first night of my 15 nights every time the guests in the room above mine walked my ceiling would creak so loudly I reported this to reception when I got back from class the next day they said Let me check The guests in that room just checked out To which I replied I m staying for 15 nights you can t assure me that you won t have guests check into that room can you To which he smugly replied We can t transfer you now You can try tomorrow morning if we have an available room NO APOLOGY And since I was taking short courses my entire stay I didn t have time to unpack and repack to move rooms It was horrible every single night 3 The unaccommodating staff Aside from what I said in number 2 I left a denim shopping bag in the room along with some other things I m willing to let go of and on the day I checked out I called them to say I m coming back for it when I get picked up by airport transport They said they ll check but when I went back the concierge just said dismissively that there s nothing I insisted that they have someone check and so he took a binder and said housekeeping reports all items left behind here and there s nothing in your room I can understand if they just don t keep things left behind but THEY COULD SAY IT POLITELY LIKE THEY ACTUALLY CARE BECAUSE I PAID 95 GBP PER NIGHT FOR 15 NIGHTS 4 The pathetic service They have old carpet on the narrow corridors leading to the rooms It s so difficult to pull luggage on it and when I was led to my room I wasn t even offered help with my 2 pieces of luggage which I was clearly having difficulty with despite them being Rimowa with 4 wheels 5 The lack of linens 
Commodore Hotel, Old building with poor maintenance Elevator super small Sofa bed is nod bed just sofa ok for a child no for a teenager or adult Check in and check out a nightmare We didn t get the room we paid for No worries to try to solve the problem at all Traveling with children the guy at the reception pretend to fit everyone in a king size bed During the check out we were asked if we had used the mini bar and even when we said no we were charged with mini bar Again no worries to verify the mistake when finally decided to check and confirm the mistake no chance we can get the money back for being a weekend 
Commodore Hotel, The furniture and carpets are really old The carpet has lost all it s colours since it s been fitted tens of years ago The check out is too early 11 00 and when we asked the receptionist if we could leave luggage in the hotel so we don t carry it all day with us before catching a train this was declined saying that there is no space for our luggage 
Commodore Hotel, No hot water for 3 nights and money was taken from my account without any notice or a final bill breakdown I can t for the life of me work out why we have been charged what we have I expected a decent demonstration of goodwill in terms of a refund for our dreadful experience but none has been forthcoming so far booking com are looking into it but it s taking ages to get a resolution Staff were far from friendly and courteous and there seemed to be a language barrier Breakfast was mediocre at best coffee awful and orange juice was freshly squeezed from a carton of Asda Value orange juice I could go on but I really do not want to waste my time on this any more dreadful experience very poorly handled not a 4 experience 
Commodore Hotel, The bed was awful Room freezing cold due to heating not working The toilet blocked several times Tv was tiny and I could hear every word from the room next door To top it off the iron which must be about 15 years old ruined the shirt my boyfriend had just purchased for the evening due to the dirt inside 
Commodore Hotel, Air conditioning was noisy and balcony door didn t lock without a key which we weren t allowed to have
Commodore Hotel, Room offered in a poorly unready state with used towels everywhere We have been relocated 3 times during stay without apology Bed sheets feel dirty with yellow stains Staff barely speaks and understands English 
Commodore Hotel, The property was extremely dated The bedroom was horrendous Curtains broken carpet dirty and bathroom wasn t cleaned The furniture was broken and dated We tried to check in 1 30 but room not available We went back at 7 to be told they didn t have a double room and would upgrade us but because I refused to pay the extra 50 deposit making it 100 00 they seemed to find me this horrid room I d asked for a room with a view as my 11 year son had never visited London before OMG it was of back buildings So so disappointed I cannot tell you PLEASE read all reviews though I had and thought I m sure itl be ok but how wrong was I I truely recommend not going there 
Commodore Hotel, The cleaner must have come into the room 4 or 5 times on leaving day from half 8 til 10am to check if we were ready to go yet check out was meant to be at 11 Felt very rushed so she let the hotel down a bit 
Commodore Hotel, Room service for food is not 24 7 nothing really to dislike
Commodore Hotel, Beds were a bit firm and the room was small Decor was jaded 
Commodore Hotel, Nothing much negative The reception process seems to treat everyone like a potential criminal coying photo ID not simply checking it against the registration form large deposit taken on a credit card in case you use hotel services Not really very welcoming and not a one off as it was the same the last time I stayed Other places do the same thing but they are much more tactful One bedside lamp didn t work at all the other had loose wiring and flickered and flashed off if moved The hot water took a long time arrive at the taps 
Commodore Hotel, The bed was a little too firm for our liking but not totally uncomfortable 
Commodore Hotel, The staff at the reception was nasty and not helpful at all The room we ve been given that meant to be double was smaller than a single room at trvelodge when we requested bigger room the staff member became verbally aggressive The room was dirty hair in the sink stains on the carpet dirty towels carpet not hoovered stains on the pillowcase feedback form with negative opinion left from previous guest Not happy at all DO NOT recommend this hotel to anybody even to enemy 
Commodore Hotel, The lift very small for big people The bathroom there should be a drainage on the floor where the sink is 
Commodore Hotel, Noisy room due to most probably plumbing issues We knew every time the neighbour in the next room visited his her bathroom Our bathroom extremely small Uncomfortable for two people 
Commodore Hotel, I don t know if room service for food was not available at the time I arrived as the menu actually looked really good with some lovely dishes I was given a menu from a local take out place it was pizza and pasta and the usual high carbs what I term as terrible food I m into healthy eating and gluten free if possible so I was struggling to get something reasonably healthy 
Commodore Hotel, I really didn t like the repetitive knocking at the door every morning The walls are thin so you can hear wats going on in the next room The floor also squeaks and cracks so along with thin floorplan it sounds like there s always a commotion goin on makes it hard to get a peaceful not and morning 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, First room had threadbare carpet and stained sheets Replacement room was much better but the hotel badly needs an overall update with new carpets for all rooms Reception staff were unfriendly and not surprised at complaints 
Commodore Hotel, The decoration and carpets were worn and tired looking Hotel would look much better with this issue addressed
Commodore Hotel, There was a problem with the booking We had paid for a breakfast on booking com but the people at the hotel refused to honour it despite being shown the email They tried to make us pay for it and held us up by insisting on discussion it Really this was between the hotel and the booking company if they don t want to use a booking company they shouldn t do it Or they should fulfill obligations without argument It certainly was not our problem 
Commodore Hotel, Thw shower although quiet powerful could not be could be hung on the wall fixture because the fixture was broken Alsi the shower curtain was very flimsy and stuck ti you while you wete showering
Commodore Hotel, On arrival we were allocated a top floor apartment whilst the apartment was nice there had been a bed made up in the lounge area that we didn t require We asked if we could put the bed away and we re told that it was broken The bed took up all of the lounge defeating the object of staying in an apartment keeping the lounge and bedrooms separate Secondly and most importantly the locks on the windows of the bedrooms were broken we were 6 floors up and there was a sheer drop to the ground The windows opened up fully and with ease and as we have small children we asked if the locks could be fixed or if we could move to another apartment We were told the locks couldn t be fixed that day and they had no more apartments left so we were moved to what they described as a family suite The suite was in fact a small room on the 7th floor with 2 beds in it it was old dated beyond hot and extremely noisy The bathroom was disgusting this is apparently a 4 hotel We explained that we were not happy and that we had paid for an apartment and that s what we wanted The manager assured us he would do his best to sort out an alternative apartment the following day but we would have to stay in the family suite the first night We were told we would have to pack all our belongings up for a third time and that we would be moved the next day We went off in to London to spend the half term with our children seeing the sights we were contacted by staff at the hotel no less than 10 times throughout our day asking us various questions and completely ruining our day out The manager also insisted we return to the hotel at 3pm to have a meeting All while we were simply trying to enjoy our time away with our children On return to the hotel later that evening my husband was summoned to another meeting lasting over 40 minutes by the manager 
Commodore Hotel, The mattresses need updating URGENTLY Invest in some free view channels The carpet was worn and filthy staff are probably under pressure NOT to vacuum Other guests were inconsiderate no noise policy in place banging doors and shouting across corridors at any and all hours of the day night Walls are paper thin Pillows are even thinner The gym equipment is laughable just do away with it in the advert and the TV sets need to go The whole experience was just awful The apologetic staff did little to ease how i regarded my stay For the price tag it is day light robbery 
Commodore Hotel, The only thing I didn t love about our stay was that we had a do not disturb sign on our door while out and about in the city and the cleaning staff came in anyways Not a huge issue as it s always nice to come home to a clean room however we personally prefer to live in and have cleaning done at the end 
Commodore Hotel, The Central Heating Radiator badly needs Bleeding it has a lot of air inside causing the Control Valve to Buzz very loudly even when set at 0 at regular intervals ruining your nights sleep Room 704 Hotel please note and Rectify 
Commodore Hotel, Full English Breakfast was a tad expensive at 12 95 each and fairly average to be honest If it had been better I may have paid for the second day but in the end found a better caf around the corner which was better value and better taste The hotel is a little bit shabby in places which a little more TLC or maybe a bit of touch up painting would improve for a small cost However this was fine given the cost of our stay so I have not marked the hotel down for this as overall I would definitely stay there again 
Commodore Hotel, Room at basement level Had I known I would end up with that room I would not have paid 99 pounds for it the carpet in the room did not look great
Commodore Hotel, Check in was awful treated like we were not trusted Rooms were incredibly noisy could here upstairs and next door water and walking about Maid just walked in without knocking a hour before check out time Then 10 mins later was knocking again Our kettle kept switching on and boiling dry but staff didn t seem to care of fire hazard
Commodore Hotel, We were in the basement floor view of a brick wall no sunlight Two occasions where someone knocked on our door no one there when we answered Staff didn t care Room key didn t work Wifi didn t work Staff not too welcoming

Commodore Hotel, I booked the hotel to include a full english breakfast to be told a couple of days before that it was actually a mistake and they could only offer a continental breakfast On arrival at the hotel when I made an order for room service they told us that they had no food so we had to order from there partner takeaway service which was a kebab shop We ordered through the hotel 1x quarter pounder cheeseburger and paid 6 00 they delivered just a portion of chips that we did not order and no burger Spoke to the hotel and the kebab shop and was refused my money back the hotel did nothing to follow this up so I was without the correct food I ordered and down by 6 00 From the room service menu there was a cream tea which was a tea and a fruit scone the man said they should have this 10 minutes later he come up to the room with just a cup of earl grey tea an apple and an orange to compensate for the scone and charged me 5 00 there was already tea in the room So I refused to pay this as firstly I asked for english breakfast tea and not early grey secondly there was already tea in the room I just wanted to order the cream tea as it came with a scone but they was unable to provide this In the end I disputed this 5 00 charge for the wrong tea and they removed this from the bill 
Commodore Hotel, Dusty I ve been sneezing throughout the duration of my stay I don t think the old curtains carpets top of bed cloth decors are getting washed on a regular basis I still have to put a 50 deposit in case there s a damage to property in which is a big turn off because they can always find a tiny reason to blame and therefore they can easily say I broke something which I didn t It s a win win situation when it comes to this appalling style of deposit just to extort money from customers in a legitimate way 
Commodore Hotel, The room was very hot especially on the first night and I was unable to lower the temperature or put a fan on 
Commodore Hotel, 1 Front desk stuffs are not friendly flexible especially the Indian or similar race employee claimed that we could not have our luggage stored when we check out the check out is early at 11am and our schedule to airport is at 3pm It was when we were prepare to throw a fight with him that he became flexible I wish the hotel would improve on their customer service 2 The room G1 that we stayed the carpet is balding stained Cleanliness is not at its best I think it s time for the hotel to upgrade the room s fixtures fittings 
Commodore Hotel, The hairdrier did not work very well and our room was on the ground floor and overlooked an inner courtyard with noisy machines 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel itself is incredibly outdated and could do with a serious update The carpets appeared filthy I felt I had to wear shoes in my room The throw on my bed was tired and had some sort of coffee ring stain The fitness centre was extremely limited and the WiFi was exceptionally poor slow and kept dropping out The bed was exceptionally uncomfortable I like a firm mattress but this was like lying on a board and the pillows were flat lumpy Not impressed and would not consider staying here again 
Commodore Hotel, Bathroom was clean but not spotless Some mouldy bits and shower curtain made shower really narrow 
Commodore Hotel, The staff would put a letter under the door daily telling you that although you request no room cleaning after 3 days they require to be cleaned Ok so on that day we left and came back after 8 to 10 hours of being gone and our room door was ajar A slight Crack and not pulled shut Luckily for us nothing going was taken but definitely made the staff aware that this was unacceptable 
Commodore Hotel, We were disappointed with the executive suite very small window opened out on to the service yard not at all executive The room service was VERY poor It took three attempts to get the basics of a very simple order any where near correct We ordered a Afternoon Tea which was supposed to consist of a selection of sandwiches and cakes along with cream scones and strawberry preserve we got two scones and cream no preserve no knifes no milk when eventually preserve was brought it was marmalade at which stage we just gave up There was a lot of noise throughout the night people running up and down the corridor and slamming doors 
Commodore Hotel, Old furniture as well as I couldn t see from the window as the mechanism to put up the curtain was broken Very difficult to orientate till you get to your room Wifi just for one application It means that only one person could use it 
Commodore Hotel, Very limited menu room service only the restaurant wasn t open in the evening No alcoholic drinks although a well stocked room bar with a choice of soft drinks 
Commodore Hotel, The quality of the rooms is quite bad overall Everything in the hotel is tiny Bathrooms are small and cheaply built The continental breakfast was not really eatable overcooked eggs and cheese which is wet from fat Due to planned engineering works at the nearby underground station the hotel is not that easy to reach And the worst the hotel is that bad built that I woke up every time sbd used a bathroom next to above or under my room 
Commodore Hotel, The room was too small for a couple The lift was dodgy the carpet worn and the people in the next room had very loud sex on most nights followed by hurried footsteps past our room afterwards 
Commodore Hotel, The corridors were red hot uncomfortable the lift was tiny there was lots of noise lasting for over 3 5 hours in our first night and the hotel did little to resolve
Commodore Hotel, We arrived back at the hotel on day 2 of our trip to find a live cockroach on the floor We were given a different room but we never expected to see a cockroach in our room Although the hotel looked relatively clean and tidy it obviously wasn t We were not offered any compensation for this and hardly an apology It felt like this happens more often than not Would definitely never recommend or return

Commodore Hotel, The carpets needs to be changed But didn t bother the experience just my own observation The bed wasn t the best 
Commodore Hotel, What I didn t like this time was that the room we got was only accessible via 3 flights of stairs It was ok this time because I travelled light but had I been with my family it would have been a tragedy A warning note would have been nice 
Commodore Hotel, The photo s shown on booking com were nothing like the room we had Tiny room worn carpet cracked mirror in bathroom dirty sink area and miserable staff Not happy 
Commodore Hotel, We booked and Executive Double bedroom and received a shoe box The room was tiny you had to walk like a crab between the bed and wardrobe to get to the other side of the room The carpet was coming up in places and it was horrifically stained there was a massive brown stain in one corner looked like it might have been false tan or something I have stayed in Travelodges far nicer and cleaner than this place The hotel itself was grotty appreciate it is an old hotel but if you re boasting 4 stars and charging that amount per room you would expect it to be a bit up to date or at least clean I booked this for myself my parter and another room for my parents for a night out in London to say we were all highly disappointed is an understatement I complained at the desk about the state of the room and was just stared at blankly I was then told that if I come back at 8am the following morning they MIGHT be able to offer me complimentary breakfast Poor customer service as if i m going to set my alarm to get up and go seeking a free breakfast something should have been offered on the spot as is common practice in customer service Really really disappointing altogether 
Commodore Hotel, Blocked twice total charge on my card and then wanted 50 pounds deposit still Have not got it back even though room was left perfect very bad experience and nobody to be held responsible This hotel not worth the hassle and I organise trips regularly will tell people to avoid it still waiting on my 50 pounds
Commodore Hotel, Terrible staff Last day there was an extremely rude receptionist They lost our luggage that was left in storage after that they have realized that it was locked somewhere and they could not find the key It took them more than an hour and only after my call to the POLICE they finally opened the door and returned me the bags BUT I missed the last train and was almost late to the airport Very very stressful 
Commodore Hotel, The mattress was quite worn A new one is badly necessary For the next one it might be clever to use a mattress cover to expand the lifespan of the mattresses As our room was in the basement we cleary heard the underground trains passing the hotel If you are very sensitive to noises you shall mention this before 
Commodore Hotel, Cramped room despite it being executive double The carpet was stained and threadbare The furniture was chipped missing handles and doors The bedside lighting had wiring taped up which is a health hazard Plugs were virtually impossible to access through cabinets The bathroom had broken tiles and tiles that were loose The heated towel rail was broken The lift was broken which enabled us to walk up the stairs to view the poor decoration of the building that was evident in our room Website photos do not correlate to reality

Commodore Hotel, Staff were rude and unhelpful we were placed in a basement room that smelt damp and had peeling plaster our view was of some grates that cover the storage heaters The bathroom was very cramped with the shower tray having a crack running through it also the cradle for the shower head was not fitted correctly so it fell off each time you attempted to use it As a responsible guest I had reported these issues so the following morning we were visited by maintenance and cleaning staff from 9am This hotel saw fit to ruin my stay with this behaviour as I had traveled to London for a relaxing time and this was spoilt by their insistence to fixing these issues they could have simply waited until I d checked out to do this If you want to stay in a hotel that completely inconsiderate of it s guest stay at the commodore hotel 
Commodore Hotel, I expected more from a top scoring property with excellent reviews perhaps they could use some of the money paid to them to re lay the thread bare stained carpets Also being able to hear the people in the next room talking is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, An older hotel that does offer character but a bit tired in places especially room carpets 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms were very small tired and dated Everything was dirty Shabby and in need of a good clean I have no idea at all how it is classed ad 4 star it should be 2 star 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms do vary and some of the carpets could do with a makeover but that s made up for by the wonderful reception lounge 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel is dated the condition of the common areas is poor The carpet are worn stained and dirty The carpet in the rooms are in a similar condition On the day night of my stay there was no hot water and no effort was made to inform guest of this problem The air conditioning unit in my room was not working and requires a service I have stayed in the hotel on a number of occasions over the past 24 months I have noticed a gradual detrrioration of the rooms and common areas over this time It is not value for money any more 
Commodore Hotel, As a family of 5 we booked paid for a 2 bedroom apartment On arrival were told they had made a mistake with our booking We were given a 1 bedroom apartment with an extra z bed No refund of price was offered All items in kitchen were for 4 people so facilities didn t meet our needs Sofa bed z bed were so uncomfortable They gave us complimentary breakfast it wasn t a full English it was a very basic continental buffet food was poor I absolutely would not recommend this hotel apartments to anyone especially a family We should of a my the very least been refunded the difference in price 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, The room was supposed to be one of their best The room smelled musty the furniture was old and uncomfortable the carpets where dirty and frayed ripped in places and the shower had black mould and ingrained dirt on the tiles sealant and grout the roller blind had dead flies embedded on it The restaurant and room service is non existent and the hairdyer didn t work Tried to upload pictures but the site upload isn t working properly and could only upload the one picture
Commodore Hotel, The room was in the basement grim and smelled musty damp not to mention the beetle or cockroach not sure which in the bathroom The restaurant didn t exist and the room service consisted of takeout menus which you had to collect from reception 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms were smaller than expected barely fitting for two people The bathrooms even smaller When we arrived the room looked like it hasn t been cleaned for days the carpet was stained Room service barely did any vacuuming they only made the bed and that is all Definitely NOT value for money Please spend your money elsewhere with the rates we got which was quite expensive we did not even get breakfast 
Commodore Hotel, The price went from 130 to 170 because I changed the date by one week when I arrived the price was 175 plus breakfast I was with my wife so didnt want to start a fuss as it was our anniversary The bedroom was cramped the bed was like sleeping on a door The dinning room was far to small for the amount of people staying It was chaotic To be honest I am a seasoned traveller Ive only ever stayed in a hotel this poor on one other occasion It felt like a second rate guest house 
Commodore Hotel, First room carpet was filthy pillows were gross Faucet in bathroom leaked toilet didn t flush properly electrical outlets didn t work
Commodore Hotel, shower not working stained carpet in room no biscuits with tea and coffee in room no bar in hotel and no alcohol in mini bar
Commodore Hotel, Very small lift just big enough for two and a small suitcase
Commodore Hotel, Thought breakfast was included which it was not Also fire Alarm kept going off which meant had to wait for it to be sorted but it was 1 30 2 am in the morning 
Commodore Hotel, As soon as we entered the apartment I sat on a chair and noticed that it was unstoppable Two legs were broken We moved it carefully and did not complain about it After returning home I received the following email from the manager Dear Ms Due to the damaged chair that was left upon your departure we have charged 80 as damage fees from your card Please find the relevant pictures enclosed Best Regards Commodore Hotel I am really sorry about it They accused us of damaging their property I can t really believe this behaviour I Sent an email and told them that we have not broken that chair but they paid no attention I liked their hotel and the staff I wish they haven t changed my mind Sorry
Commodore Hotel, Cleanliness we spotted a mouse in our room which was supposed to be an upgraded executive room it was terrible stay and we would never stay there again The carpets beyond the reception were threadbare and the furniture in the room was worn beyond words 
Commodore Hotel, Thin walls extremely poor sound proofing could hear quests above and the room next to ours 
Commodore Hotel, Facilities were quite dated and worn We were taken back a bit by a warning letter we received for keeping a few bottles of water in the mini fridge Ridiculous additional fees or a fine if we kept them there 
Commodore Hotel, No strong alcohol choice in the minibar 
Commodore Hotel, The furniture was cracked the walls were unclean and the bed base was broken along with having to go up 97 steps to get to my apartment
Commodore Hotel, The carpet was disgusting The walls had mold on them and were stained The windows were dirty The general cleanliness of the hotel was one of the poorest I ve ever stayed in Definitely not a 3 start should be advertised as 2 Urgently needs to undergo a renovation
Commodore Hotel, The floorboards are so creaky that every time the person in the room above moved you would know about it Keeps you awake at nights I m sure not in every room but would avoid in the future 
Commodore Hotel, My room could have been better There was a huge crack on the wall where the air con was fitted and the carpet was not very clean
Commodore Hotel, The hotel was a bit rundown and didn t really look like in the pictures Old furniture creaky floor old carpets The bathroom definitely needed renovating 
Commodore Hotel, I would be happier if this property had a lift 55 stairs was sometimes beyond my ability 
Commodore Hotel, The remote control unit on the TV did not work and despite efforts to replace this was never done Using the TV was therefore difficult during our stay 
Commodore Hotel, The lift The mouse that came to visit Worn carpets Doors that don t close properly I will be contacting you as I have been charged twice for my room 
Commodore Hotel, The whole room and hotel experience was very disappointing Very noisy room the room was very tired carpet ripped stained and worn out chipped sink and broken plug The hotel and room just were not 4 star quality as advertised 
Commodore Hotel, We had a good sized room and bathroom but the hotel does seem a little out dated and dirty The Hotel is in need of a little restoration or deep cleaning We had mould growing inside the shower and my girlfriend was complaining about the hairdryer as it was from the 80s If you are thinking of staying bring your own hairdryer Probably shouldn t be rated as a four star hotel 
Commodore Hotel, Dirty and tired bedroom The bed was almost as big as the room Was a poor option for the money I paid I tried to get a refund for my second night but couldn t as I booked through booking com
Commodore Hotel, There are no near facilities early check out the cleaniness of the tiolet was not great
Commodore Hotel, Given wrong room despite booking and arriving on time double instead of suite and offered no apology or reduction in price other than two complimentary continental breakfasts which had a poor selection Room was incredibly noisey and nowhere near what you d expect for a 4 star hotel Tiny lift and worn carpets tatty furniture overpriced plug sockets minimal and inconvenient to get to Also our luggage was stored unacceptably for hours in main reception area by a communal doorway Very disappointing 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms were very small and very noisy We all found it difficult to sleep In addition the showers were actually quite dangerous falling shower head and scolding hot water without warning 
Commodore Hotel, Hotel needs to be cleaned from top yo toe TV would only change channel if i switched off and on all the time they offer room service but DONT use it Its microwaved food Mine arrived frozen still They should be advertising as a 3 Star 
Commodore Hotel, Very tiny room not even room to close the curtains Extremely thin walls we could hear everything that was going on in the other rooms I did not think the room reflected the price 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Like staying in a creaky old b b old wornout carpets dated maghogany furniture ancient mattress shower flooded the bathroom no plug for the sink creaky floorboards upstairs better hotels for the money despite the value
Commodore Hotel, Small television Internet could be faster We also had problems to link the laptops wirelessly to the internet from 3rd floor but no problems with the mobile phones The sound from nearby room upstairs was a bit penetrable The training facilities could have be more accessible we detected a room for training locked with a padlock not very inviting or motivating We assumed that the training room because of the padlock was not very updated but we never went into it The staff could have been more relaxed and friendly when we arrived too much focus on the payment arrangement that we were credible visitors 
Commodore Hotel, Booked a room for 3 that wasn t available so had to have a double and a single decor v tired in communal areas rooms nice 
Commodore Hotel, We ordered continental breakfast buffet lovely selection and standard however we got our own tea and then were only offered a cup by a lovely lady at table as we were about to leave restaurant Breakfast was advertised as served until 10 30 we arrived at 10 I assumed we could enter until 10 30 but in fact it was cleared at this time maybe allow entry till then and leave buffet till 10 45 Minor detail 
Commodore Hotel, Carpets are very worn plumbing for shower difficult to use Hard to get a temperature which isn t boiling hot or cold managed in the end after lots of fine adjustments to the taps Air con made occasional loud buzzing noise Very minor thing but plug sockets by the bed would be great for charging phone at night 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel and rooms were looking tired The mark on the cleanliness is due to the carpets needing replacing and fixtures in bathroom also
Commodore Hotel, Everything just not what I expected for a so called 4 star hotel It is in need of a complete overhaul from the threadborn carpets to the decor to the furniture to the cleanliness of the bathroom Never again Just a very poor hotel 
Commodore Hotel, 1 I thought I had 2 hours for the checkout because of my genius membership with booking com but the hotel informed me that it s not true and they had many customers from booking com claiming 2 hours 2 This hotel is very far from 4 stars I m used to american hotels This hotel is similar to what you get in a 2 2 5 stars hotel in America 
Commodore Hotel, We had 5 rooms and all of them needed repairs The AC leaked water in some of the rooms the bathroom tap sprayed water in two rooms and one room had a bad smell In one room was much noise from the pipes and they had to change rooms This is old hotel and I am not going to stay there again 
Commodore Hotel, N A
Commodore Hotel, They took money from my card for extras on check in but then informed me there was no bar or restaurant I daren t ask what extras they were offering This place is shabby dingy and not worth the money Avoid Also bizarrely they asked if I wanted to pay in Romanian currency 
Commodore Hotel, Lift small old We used the narrow stairs which was not a problem and kept us fit 
Commodore Hotel, The room was very noisy Boiler woke us everytime somone in the hotel used water The bedroom upstairs floor creaked as such we had a poor nights sleep 
Commodore Hotel, Booked an apartment Given a room Was promised twice that a discount would be applied still waiting Carpets very threadbare room too hot and stuffy a c makes a lot of noise but to no effect 
Commodore Hotel, This hotel is tired and in need of updating No hotel bar The carpet had bald patches the bathroom was a bit mouldy and the water from the shower ran hot cold scalding at times 
Commodore Hotel, Not 4 star Very dated decor Desperately needs redecorating Our apartment we booked was not available so we were given a room Not real coffee at breakfast and not offered a pot of tea not n
Commodore Hotel, Tap in bathroom leaked and on our last day the shower temperature was very variable

Commodore Hotel, The tapp was leaking and the shower s temperature would keep changing dramatically 
Commodore Hotel, Little things that i would hope were high on the maintenance man s list i e slight damage to toilet flush 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Shower curtain should be replaced with glass On booking com had a genius bonus for late check out which I don t exactly know what means As booking com does tell you about a lot of bonuses which actually are only virtual Any way requested for late check out only by 1 hour but was asked to pay 20pounds more 
Commodore Hotel, Some of the hard to reach places hadn t been dusted for a while but everywhere else was cleaned properly The decor is a little tired Redecoration needed soo 
Commodore Hotel, The tiny lifts and the narrow corridors but I think most hotels in Europe are like that anyway so I guess there was nothing we didn t really like 
Commodore Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 2am due to dripping water poor maintenance All guests needed to evacuate In the morning there was no apology or any offer of compensation for a broken nights sleep A bond of 50 is held for a month after checkout far too long 
Commodore Hotel, The fire alarm going off in the early hours of the morning dude to a water leak That supposedly has happened before probably should get that sorted 
Commodore Hotel, We were unlucky with the rooms we ve got The first one was tiny and the air conditioner didn t work So we were moved to a newly refurbished and bigger one Unfortunately water started dripping through the bathroom ceiling the next morning so we had to move again This time to the basement where a light sleeper hears a distant sound from the underground Regrettably we were woken on our last night by the fire alarm at 1 30am which kept going on and on and on for some time until somebody shut it off completely Luckily there was no real fire that night The Commodore Manager was very nice and tried to sort out the water dripping from the ceiling situation He gave us a room at the same floor so we can shower and showed us 3 new rooms to choose from Additionally we were given two vouchers for breakfast which I wouldn t recommend to pay The service staff at breakfast was very poor and not friendly However we lost a couple of valuable hours with moving rooms London is an expensive city and you don t expect luxury for a decent priced hotel however all bathrooms need some work done we ve seen 4 and if you have the chance get a newly refurbished room with a working a c 
Commodore Hotel, Staff left a note because I had used fridge for item I bought outside hotel that threatened a 50 GBP charge to clean fridge and informed me a separate fridge could be hired for 39 GBP per night The fridge was not clean in the first place Was promised my deposit would be refunded within 7 days we are home now after 3 weeks and still no sign of refund 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, The first room I was given the carpet had so many stains that I didn t want to take off my shoes I mentioned the carpet situation to the front desk agent and she mentioned it was just replaced Maybe it was 20 years ago Had to switch rooms because there was a leak in my room by the bathroom The second room I was switched too was not much better My bathroom was missing a door knob In the morning I had to get dressed and go to the front desk to get someone to open my door so I could use the washroom Had to wait for someone to come in with a tool box so they could open the door Found a hair clip in my bed so clearly the room was not cleaned properly When I asked to speak to a manager there was no manager on staff until 10am Horrible stay and hotel 
Commodore Hotel, the room could have been a bit bigger 
Commodore Hotel, I did not like that on the first day during the time when we were out the house keeper seems to look in to our stuff Nothing was stolen but still it was really unpleasant surprise After we complain to the register in the next days everything was great 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Everything else was beyond awful The fridge inside didn t work the shower flooded the water temperature fluctuated from scalding to freezing and would even switch off entirely The sink tap spits water at you as the plumbing is hopeless The curtains in the room are hung on with seriously sharp hooks bent to all proportions and fall off occasionally the TV regularly turned on by itself during the night due to a timer that couldn t be changed and the air conditioner blows out dust as the bottom section is not closed off Plus the top floor cannot be accessed by the lift and the lift itself can only fit 1 person with luggage at a time The staff did not appear surprised when we raised concerns about the fridge not working I suspect they ve heard it all before A real shame this hotel could be so much more 
Commodore Hotel, choice was 6th floor with no lift or cellar first room had 1 toilet not working I needed to insist to get the water supply cut in order to be able to sleep 2nd room was in the cellar with dirty carpet and dirty bathroom VERY poor bed couldn t do more than 3 nights
Commodore Hotel, The shower was either incredibly hot or incredibly cold The room had a ledge that was lose and therefore useless as everything fell 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel was scruffy and run down Dead plants on the doorstep and pop music playing in the lobby in an Edwardian style hotel was really tacky I was in a room facing the inner courtyard with a view of air con pipes and some plastic plants in pots The courtyard was netted against pigeons the net was full of litter The room was dusty the bathroom door handle broken the shower curtain mouldy and the hairdryer cut out every 30 seconds due to overheating Staff and guests sitting smoking on the front steps created a really poor impression on arrival The lounge was closed off with plastic hazard tape It was somewhere to lay my head for the night the best I can say is that the sheets were clean 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, The first night I was put in a room located at the 7th floor no elevator on this floor got to stop on the 6th and climb some stairs which was next to the elevators generator or something that was extremely noisy and totally unacceptable I called the reception who offered me straight away an option to change room but as it was 12 30 at night I preferred to move to another room in the morning The next day I moved to a 3 bed room 3rd floor which was very spacious and great However I consider bad choice to put me next to the noise in the first place as they were aware of the problem At least they were very helpful and wanted to make up immediately In addition the hotel is relatively old and requires some maintenance On the other hand the great location 3 4 minutes from Lancaster Gate station and the helpful staff especially the Greek Receptionist will make me to visit again this hotel 
Commodore Hotel, Hotel in need of refurbishment Bathroom was adequate but water temperature fluctuated Fire alarm went off at 2am but false alarm because water had caused a short circuit 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Not being able to open the window We were on the 6th Floor so it was understandable but the room was very stuffy 
Commodore Hotel, I had to move rooms because the water didn t drain out of my shower so my bathroom flooded Then my shower in the second room went from scolding hot to freezing cold and was never a suitable temperature to shower under The hotel called me back after i told them about this problem and said they would look at the issue But they followed up with an email saying that after investigation they found nothing was wrong with my second room shower The email implied I had made it up They offered an abysmal discount and made me feel like I was the one that had done something wrong Whilst checking in several other customers were complaining about various things and were met with blank helpless expressions at reception Not nearly enough man power either 
Commodore Hotel, The conditions of the rooms I asked to be moved because the first room smelt stale Smokey and damp the staff were helpful and offered me a twin room not ideal but did smell of fresh paint the rest of the room was tired the carpet was threadbare there was paint all over the carpet and generally the room was the type you would get in a 2 star hotel 
Commodore Hotel, Shower that scalded mid use Lights not hanging by a wire Carpet not threadbare Enough room to stretch my arms out The public areas of the hotel were fine the rest shabby I won t be recommending Poor vfm 
Commodore Hotel, One of the 2 plug sockets were hanging off the bedroom wall the electrics tripped out The decorators woke us up at 8am on a weekend after travelling until late the previous day The broken shower flooded the whole bathroom when used The broken sink tap squirted water all over the bathroom The bedside table had one leg broken so needed propping up carefully and the draw hung out 
Commodore Hotel, Carpets on the stairs are showing there age and the detailing could be better paint work in the bedroom bathroom
Commodore Hotel, The suite we had was very tired looking Not all the bulbs worked Repairs were required and some had not been finished very well 
Commodore Hotel, Definitely not 4 star more like 3 star Rooms were small but typical of European hotels The beds were very hard 
Commodore Hotel, Carpets are terrible worn and stained General maintenance needed Only one tiny lift that took ages 
Commodore Hotel, Breakfast was a bit expensive but we were travelling on a budget otherwise absolutely nothing 
Commodore Hotel, The shower door was broken and the bathroom was very small The carpet in the basement was disgusting unhygenic and dirty Terrible view of a tarpaulin and pipes 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Carpet was worn right in the middle of the room there was paint on the floor The room was tiny and the walls were so thin I could hear the man next door brushing his teeth 
Commodore Hotel, Couldn t plug kettle in duvet didn t fit bed room smelt of paint lights didn t work blind was broken 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Shower was difficult to adjust potentially dangerous Rooms very close to each other Other guests came home at 2 30am and I was kept awake The breakfast was very well cooked but little choice so had to have full breakfast which was too big 
Commodore Hotel, After being shown to our room We discovered the bed was broken We complained and told there is only one more room in the place In the basement This wasn t great but we didn t have a choice so accepted it Then discovered that half the sockets on the room didn t work This if we r honest was more annoying than a problem Then after a few drinks and a meal in London we get back to the hotel Into bed only to find out that the underground runs under our room That will be us awake till 1 2am Then at 7am the front desk phones us to say that s our wake up call Which is fine Except we didn t ask for a bloody wake up call No apology No nothing Not one manager spoke to us about our disappointing stay after we complained numerous times Would stay again 
Commodore Hotel, the ubiquitous foam rubber pillows dim lighting for bathroom mirror shabby furnishings but forgivable for 95 in central London 
Commodore Hotel, Outside balcony with chairs and small table hasn t been cleaned in years Looks appalling Breakfast room is a bit small English breakfast is a bit stodgy Bacon and sausages were very salty and oily fried eggs just ok Better value for in small cafes around corner Corridors on non suite side were very narrow and pokey looking
Commodore Hotel, Check in was a bit lengthy having to supply ID then charged a 50 deposit for one night stay Emailed twice in the previous week to check in at 12pm as opposed to 2pm didnt get a reply 
Commodore Hotel, I stayed in basment which wasn t indicated during the reservation Worst thing was that every 10 minutes terrible noise came from boiler room which was adjacent to my room and we couldn t sleep Tip for other guests makes sure you indicate in your booking that you do not wish to stay in the basement
Commodore Hotel, The condition of the room in the hotel and apartment we had were not great floors had stains and the hotel room smelt a little musty wouldn t say it was 4 for hotel rooms Sofa bed in the apartment was extremely creaky and could not be folded so was a bit out of place in the lounge dining area and in the room for 3 there was barely a sofa bed just a thin small sofa with sheets on top if there are larger guests it would not be appropriate 
Commodore Hotel, The staff is kind and smiling Unfortunately behind this kindness there s no real willing to provide proper service On the second day of our staying in the hotel hot water finished in our room We had to move to another room The only available room was really downgraded although the at the reception we were told that it was a very good one It s enough to say that it was a smoked room It was also cold and the air conditioner was broken There was no personal lights near the beds and so on Only when I really insisted they finally found one better room 
Commodore Hotel, The sound of furniture moving around in the room above but it didn t last long
Commodore Hotel, The bathroom was very dated Shower was good once we got it to work Fixtures and fittings looked very tired and worn Basic shower curtain replaced the obviously broken previous screen 
Commodore Hotel, The breakfast was very expensive 15 GBP for a mediocre meal 
Commodore Hotel, Carpet in the room was very threadbare and could do with either replacing or covering with a rug 
Commodore Hotel, Layout was a little odd No ironing facilities in the room Our shower was poor
Commodore Hotel, the building is old so you can hear people walking and sometimes talking Could be disturbing at night
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, See above
Commodore Hotel, It s advertised as a 4 hotel however I have stayed in hostels with better quality than this hotel I would not recommend to anyone As I had to complain twice to get my room changed as it was not what I payed for The shower as you can see in the pic I have posted the door is the opening forward so if you wanted to close to have a shower you would have to be a skinny minny to do it so otherwise you wouldn t be able to close the door 
Commodore Hotel, Security deposit taken from me on arrival after payment with no previous mention and not returned until after I arrived home from my trip Lack of communication with staff after I requested a late check out I was disturbed 3 times within an hour 
Commodore Hotel, The room was basic and small Slightly outdated There was not a bar or anywhere to socialise The cleaner kept knocking on our door asking if we wanted a clean despite having checked twice the same day we had the door tag on too The lift was very small 
Commodore Hotel, Very run down Carpets threadbare and whole hotel is in need of decoration Noisy generator air system at night
Commodore Hotel, The door between the bedroom and the lobby where the door to the bathroom is situated could not be shut as it crashed into the bed and therefore had to remain propped open with a chair which resulted in the reduced access to the desk 
Commodore Hotel, Staff friendly but miserable looking boss like lady hovering about makes it uncomfortable Beautiful furniture but odd modern and cheapstuff added inbetween makes it look cheap 
Commodore Hotel, There was a draft coming through to the room and right over the bed where I slept It was rather uncomfortable The shower curtain in the the bath would stick to you as you had a shower they should change for glass Also rooms were very small and dormitory like uninviting and bare also
Commodore Hotel, The bed was hard Had to ask for a plug for the bath It wasn t clear that breakfast was extra price for full breakfast was shown which made it appear that Continental breakfast was included 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel needs a serious refurbishing The carpets are disgraceful and all the furniture is old the bathroom needs a good re grout and they should really come up with a safer way to lock the windows I was on the ground floor and I had to climb onto a chair to close my window They also need a better wifi connection 
Commodore Hotel,No Negative

Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Booked executive room but more like double room 206 not as advised on site TVs was poor could not get bbc Channels And had problem as text kept coming on screen electrical sockets where largely in excessable behind tv unit or under desk you had to get on your hands and knees to plug anything in including the kettle it also had to be placed on floor as the lead was not long enough asked at reception for another or an extension lead it never happened no bar in hotel either and only soft drinks in room fridge
Commodore Hotel, Rooms are a bit shabby and in need of refurbishment There are no lifts for certain parts of the building The hotel is a charming old buiding but carpets and furnishings are quite old and worn 
Commodore Hotel, The sheets weren t that clean and the furniture in the room was somehow damaged The floor was heavily stained 
Commodore Hotel, 1 I was given a room where I had to climb about 5 flights of stairs There was no lift 2 The bathroom was tiny and in the shower it was not possible to bend down or move your arms at all because of the size of the shower 3 There were two windows on the ceiling where light came down but there were no blinds to control the light It was difficult to rest and get decent sleep 4 I had paid for the room on line but at the time of check in I was told that it was not paid and I had to pay around 150 which was double the amount that I had already paid I asked the guy at the reception to check again I was then told that it was a mistake and the bill was someone else s However I was not offered any apology for this error 
Commodore Hotel, Could do with a fresh coat of paint and a general tidy up
Commodore Hotel, Not enough room for a family of 6 Quality was quite bad 
Commodore Hotel, The air conditioning unit made a noise all night resulting in not much sleep 
Commodore Hotel, This is not a four star hotel 2 to 3 at best Rooms were tired and worn and many things did not work broken shower door TV not functioning and very poor internet connection 
Commodore Hotel, Awful hotel certainly not 4 as we were led to believe Our friends had a room with step down to the room as soon as you entered the room it was dark and no notice of steps he walked in with his case and promptly fell down the flight of steps breaking his ankle in two places Ruined our weekend in London needless to say a long period of recovery for our friend Hotel staff uninterested when asked for first aider they gave us Savlon Asked to speak to manager no manager or deputy on site Rooms were disgusting thread bare stained carpets Electrics for shaving point hanging off in bathroom light switch by bed missing front cover Curtain rail just about hanging on If I was booking com I would remove them from my list of hotels and we normally use Booking com for most of our trips but would not be happy to see this hotel recommended to anyone Apart from anything else it is dangerous 
Commodore Hotel, DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL the hotel charged me three times for one night stay I emailed many times ask for refund and the hotel just ignored my email and no reply at all
Commodore Hotel, The ceiling was linking and they wanted to transfer us to a room on the basement A lot smaller than the one we had Only the next day after a huge argument suddenly they found one decent available room Very rude manager The worse hotel I ve been the last ten years Too old without facilities not even a decent coffee area Would not recommend for any reason 
Commodore Hotel, The fact there was a noisy fan outside kept me awake half the night in room 402 Also when having a bath we were told that the water was going through the ceiling and down the walls in room underneath It must have been the overflow pipe not correctly plumbed as none had spilt over the edge 
Commodore Hotel, The standard of the room was below average considering the price we paid There was lots of little things about the room that brought down the overall quality For example there were holes in the walls partially covered by paintings The tv reception was often poor and would drop out There was a big crack in the floor in the corner by the shower where water would gather after dripping down the side of the shower wall As a result you could tell there was water damage to the floor underneath as it was quite warped You could tell there would be issues in future with water leaking down the walls into the floors below causing mould and structural issues Also there was no lift in the building at all which was a pain and something I didn t realise before booking here We were lucky to be on the second floor but could imagine it would have been difficult for those who ended up with a room on one of the floors above ours 
Commodore Hotel, The shower couldn t make its mind up it was either too hot or too cold 
Commodore Hotel, We were given the wrong room to begin with but this was quickly rectified Cleaning staff weren t notified that we requested late check out 
Commodore Hotel, Room was very basic which is partially understandable as its in london but cleanliness waa questionable at one point upon entering the room we saw a beetle cockroach run actoss the floor The biggest problem however was the squeaky floorboards and bed we were woken up multiple points during the night because of this and were both restless the following day as a result Will not be staying here again 
Commodore Hotel, Room was small and there was noise from something to do with heating plumbing Some confusion over breakfast charge rate and also what had been taken from the card deposit and what had been refunded Eventually sorted but irritating

Commodore Hotel, The room was very dirty the carpets where filthy and had holes in them there was stains on the ceiling and mould in the bathroom
Commodore Hotel, Tv didn t work balconey doors didn t lock bathroom was old and had mould on the shower curtains and around the shower area
Commodore Hotel,No Negative
Commodore Hotel, Although it s clean and neat the hotel is looking a bit shabby now for a 4 Carpets in my room were stained and paint peeling off walls in public areas of hotel Quiet area with a few pubs but not for people looking for exciting nightlife Will have to travel on the tubes to other areas 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel decor is becoming rather tired and the facilities have deteriorated over the years I have been visiting I suspect this is due to a change of ownership First time I have never had a continental breakfast included 
Commodore Hotel, the Internet is very very slow you can t upload or download any images the room is very very small not like the pictures there is no lift
Commodore Hotel, The room was quite tatty Dirty stained carpets lighting was thick with dust and bathroom had a lot of wood rot Paintings on wall were not straight some missing so stains on wall from where they were missing in need of a make over Just feel that because we got a cheap deal we were put in a room that was below 4 star standard The carpets on the level to the room were torn in places trip hazard And again old and tatty 
Commodore Hotel, Beautiful room but I feel in need of some TLC Lots of little things that made the room look slightly shabby which made you feel that general housekeeping wasn t high on the agender 
Commodore Hotel, Bad security Dead bolt lock broken Member of staff entered room at 2am without knocking even with do not disturb sign on door Unacceptable
Commodore Hotel, Breakfast was not included in the room price 
Commodore Hotel, On arrival i reported telephone not working no kettle and bed side lamp not working Kettle replace straight away 30 mins later a telephone guy came but after about 30 mins said he could not fix it He would return tomorrow When we left the lamp still had not been fixed and the telephone was inoperative Hence we could not use room service which ruined the stay of being in a very elite hotel and we had to go upstairs and order what we should have had a phone for 
Commodore Hotel, We 4 friends had booked a 2 bedroom apartment which was down in the basement no info on the website of that with a bunker feeling and a clear smell of mould We were offered a 1 bedroom apartment with a sofabed in replacement and the feeling from the concierge was that if we did not accept it we would not have anywhere to stay or had to go back in to the basement The apartment was poorly equipped so we did not even think about using the kitchen It was really cold in the apartment 18 so when inside we sat in the bed with our blankets on The breakfast we paid a lot extra for was not worth the penny For the same sum you get a full English breakfast at any cafe in the neighbourhood 
Commodore Hotel, Being an older building the walls and roof are very thin so noise including upstairs footsteps are very present 
Commodore Hotel, There was a small problem on checking in when I discovered that the room I was allocated was still in use The staff though dealt with it very quickly and I ended up with a really good room 
Commodore Hotel, We booked and paid for an Executive Double Room When we returned home we realised that we had been put in a standard room This is not an honourable practice It is not a 4 star hotel The decor and the carpets need to be upgraded Also we would have liked if there had been a bar in the hotel 
Commodore Hotel, The rooms were dirty Especially the carpets and sink The electrical box was exposed above the door way The tv cabinet doors were broken The sofa bed had big gaps between the end of the frame and maytress at both ends This is very dangerous for children becoming trapped The breakfast was none existent and extremely expensive We were given upgrades so i don t know what the otber rooms were like The 4 poster bed was comfy Tey didn t replenish the taea or coffee or put clean cups in the room after the first night The hotel was just lacking in all areas For the price and being in london I expected much more I recommend it if you can get a cheap deal We paid 330 253 for our rooms for 2 nights I wouldn t say it was value for money You are better off staying in a travel lodge or premier inn The location is good for winter wonderland We were disapointed 
Commodore Hotel, In need of upgrading especially some common areas and the lift is so small First room given was so small we had no room where to put our luggage Second room given larger with outdated furniture but OK Noise from generator coming from internal courtyard Highly priced for value given both for breakfast and comfort Cannot rate it for a 4 star hotel 
Commodore Hotel, The room was dirty and smells so bad The shower room didn t have any curtain The hair driver was broken But the price wasn t cheap If the photos of the booking com had told us the true situation we wouldn t have reserved I never advice you to reserve this hotel Absolutely not 
Commodore Hotel, We are a couple with 2 kids and we rented an apartment It did not work the TV the Refrigerator the toilet the windows did not close At the reception the only solution that gave us was we stay in hotel separate rooms Not accepted we separated and 22h said there was responsible person who wanted that we could not go to sleep the other hand the problem is we had already paid advance They were very rude and arrogant More inform you that the apartments are away from the hotel and that there is no mention of this and that the apartments have no lift 
Commodore Hotel, The hotel room was small and not very well appointed The Hotel was gloomy and in need of a face lift There were Health and Safety issues in that the stair carpet on the 6 th floor was fraying and loose trip hazards I have photographs The staff plainly have not had any training in customer relations or of working in a service industry Once my daughter and I had booked in NO member of staff spoke to us at all not even to say Good Morning or have you had a pleasant day it was as if we had become invisible Having not taken any heed of us as we left and returned to the Hotel I cannot imagine what a problem there would have been had there been a fire who is in the building who is not in the building the staff would not have had a clue I used to be a Management Surveyor and therefore know a lot about safety issues and the power that the Health and Safety Executive possesses Neither of the two men at Reception on the day we left made a move to help me with my case down the steps I am 71 years old female I suspect they were still reeling after I gave them my views on the Hotel It was unfortunate for this Hotel that the hotel we had staying the night before was a Premier Inn which was light bright slick and ALL the staff were smiling helpful and looked as if they gave a damn what our stay was like And happily their floors did not creak every time we made a move it was more central and also was marginally cheaper The only cheery person I encountered at the Commodore was Vincy the person who carried our cases to the room for us 
Commodore Hotel, Noise on lower level floor woke me up several times lift too small shower needs updating

Commodore Hotel, Unfortunately a very bland experience a hotel that seems to rely solely on location to get customers Not making any kind of lasting impression and therefore no incentive for me to go back On arrival I was given an upgrade for some reason and therefore given a double room w twin beds What use I as a single traveler have of a room w two beds is a mystery to me 
Commodore Hotel, I was upgraded I did not ask for the upgrade to appartment accommodation a short walk from the hotel The porter who accompanied me was new and we ended up climbing numours stairs in error When I final got to my room I did not like the alone feeling also the hotel had no restaurant for dinner and they did not do room service to the appartments so I walked back to the hotel where they were able to give me a nice room in the hotel it would have saved an unpleasant experience if they had done this first

Commodore Hotel, Hotel decor is tired and grubby Door to veranda was difficult to lock and once I had done it I couldn t open it A bit worrying when you are travelling alone The room has a damp problem so it smelled musty and unpleasant I could hear the person moving around in the room above as tbe floorboards creaked and they were up at 6 00 am so was I 
Commodore Hotel, This hotel was probably top rate about 10 years ago since then no money has been invested d cor is tired carpets worn and bathrooms are incomplete or stained This is not a 4 star hotel 
Commodore Hotel, Hostility of staff All foreign so not as understandable When booked requested early check in and the receptionist refused to even check if the room was ready until after 2 even though requested on booking online Had issue with breakfast as booked online and paid an extra 30 Extortion for what it was only to realise in hotel it was only actually 11 95 each Then we went for breakfast they told us we couldn t have any as not paid when I had booked online and had an email proving it This was very embarrassing and even after showing the staffy email and them timing reception I still had to go up to reception myself to sort it out and leave my partner very embarrassed waiting at the breakfast room 
Commodore Hotel, no bathroom heater I felt upset that no fixing up even requested for 2 days the upstair guests are very noisy throughout the day night walking heavily 
Commodore Hotel, The place was dirty and dangerous The carpet was stained dust everywhere One of the carpet steps fell off ordered two toasties arrived a hour later cold and not even toasted would not recommend to anyone

Commodore Hotel, The room had a terrible strong smell of detergent paint and they had no other room to offer so they transferred me to their affiliated hotel So Hyde Park That hotel had the worst service I have experienced in any hotel or even youth hostel and the state of the facilities made it obvious the owners do not focus on providing a good customer experience 
Commodore Hotel, The carpets hallway all needs revamping it leaves a bad taste in your mouth It made the whole stay discomforting
Commodore Hotel, The carpets were dirty and should have been shampooed My daughter had a sleep on sofa which they kindly had made up but the coverlet was dirty on the underside The room could have been much nicer with just a few touches and minor improvements 
Commodore Hotel, Lady on reception was a little rude Bedroom needed some improvement a little over priced for what it was Toilet in reception didn t have a light working
Commodore Hotel, On the 15th of August 2015 I was booked to stay at this hotel with my family As I mentioned to your receptionist at the time the accommodation was unsatisfactory in the following ways I had requested for an early check in as I was travelling with my wife and 3 young children 2 of whom are unwell at the moment with broker arms and other have stiches My request was refused on the day despite me having requested it even prior to my visit in an email And I have been inform by the representative that they are fully booked and cannot arrange any room till 2 00PM After requesting I was given accommodation a single room by hotel at my own expense 150 for just 4 hours That too it was a single double bed and we slept on that After complaining this to the higher management we got reimbursed on the check out day I have been given a apartment on the 3rd floor of the hotel without a lift this was not mentioned when I booked the hotel I would not have booked this hotel had I been made aware of these facts The stairs are very dangerous and with two handicap child it as not acceptable The Washing Machine was broken The A C was not working the Room Heater was not working the Shower was broken The Porter refused to carry my luggage up the stairs as he mentioned he was suffering from back ache YES he refused And this annoyed me When I requested to speak to the manager I was informed none of the managers were present to make decisions and I would have to wait until the following Monday for any request to be entertained Then they transferred us to the another room which as very very small in size and not up to that mark Nothing was provided properly since the moment we arrived We have changed 3 Rooms including one in Kennington in Just 12 Hours and that too with Children s and Luggage 
Commodore Hotel, Everything This is no way a 4 star Probably some fraud Even the receptionist told me that she is leaving and i should not book here again She also said i dont know how they got 4 stars rating 
Commodore Hotel, How noisy the hotel was The carpets must have needed replacing about 3 years ago they are so worn that it is almost a health hazard The place is also very dirty rooms and halls Bathrooms are a bit cleaner although my shower would not drain properly so I had to limit my shower to 3 4 minutes in order to avoid overfill flooding This was my 2nd stay and my last stay

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, small single room is a cupboard and the bathroom is a cupboard in the cupboard no other way to fill kettle but in the shower the washbasin too small only way to open suitcase is on the bed the whole thing is ridiculous 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Frankly an appauling room The single bed only just fit in front of the window Extremely Noisy all night Very hot even though it had a fan which i had to leave on all night Pillow wasnt particularly comfortable either I can live with a small room as its central london but it wasnt that hot a day so the room must suffer from a problem with the heat hence the fan and the noise from the street is just shocking One of the worst nights I have ever had in a hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The cold water didn t work they never fixed it Read the fine print carefully there was no air conditioning just a fan which I had to point at myself to keep myself cool throughout the night The room was pretty small I liked that they had a tea kettle but it was too hot to use it

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Basement room blind didn t completely came down to cover window Window overlooked a walkway staff used Room wasn t cleaned well and was very dusty Only 2 electrical sockets and 1 didn t work 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, proper coffee for breakfast would have been good rather than just filter plus better sliced bread other than the cheapest white sliced for toast Rooms were a little small but go with the age and layout of the buildings 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, dirty no air conditioning rude staff shabby decor noisy smelled dirty unhelpful reception 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small double room seemed more like a student sized halls of residence with ensuite squeezed in It was a very hot day so the window was open but the blind and the window were very dusty
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was 30 degrees when we arrived at the hotel and the air conditioning in the room didn t work As this was the reason we booked this hotel we were very disappointed I went to reception twice to ask about it but on both occasions there was nobody there We spent the night very hot and sweaty and didn t get much sleep Not what I expect for 175 pounds per night After reading the instruction chart on the room wall it appeared that the system was being over ridden by a central control We were not happy at all 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was small with no desk or place to work
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room far from clean air conditioning was a fan full of dust fire alarm flashed bright green lighting up the whole room in the night got there to discover no lift and no other staff member to help take the bags as my partner is awaiting surgery had to struggle between us Staff serving food in flip flops and leggings most certainly not 4 stars I would say 3 and pushing it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Access to electric outlets is very difficult there is no overhead lighting near the bed and no real place to put toiletries in the bathroom It was difficult to control the temperature in the room and only a duvet was available as a cover not exactly the sort of thing most people want when on a warm evening in a warm room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed very uncomfortable and the same with the pillows The towels in bathroom are in need of renewal very hard and discolered The breakfast room is downstairs there are no elevators serving any floor of this building we were fortunate to have a room on the first floor Anyone with mobility issues like myself will experience difficulty There are no bar facilities on the premises This accommodation in my opinion has been wrongfully classed as a hotel I feel this should have been classed as a Guest House 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There should be somewhere clear that tells you how the lights work with the key card or the receptionist could mention it when you check in 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room allocated next to breakfast room so noise and smells from just after 4am No ventilation as window didn t open 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 I requested a ground floor or first floor room due to mobility problems When we arrived we were told our room was on the third floor There is no lift We were then offered a room in the basement which was small the bed was small the wardrobe was small the bathroom was in a closet 2 The following morning we went for breakfast at approx 9 15am We were told without apology that breakfast finished at 9 00am It was not possible to get coffee juice toast we were told to make coffee in our room 3 My husband fell out of the bed during the night He is used to a normal sized double bed 4 Staff did not care This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and I would rate it as a 2 star We will certainly not stay there again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was ridiculously small and had no air conditioning I banged my tooth on the kettle trying to plug in my phone charger as the socket was really inaccessible 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the room first night the room was horrible they gave us room that is not the same from the site It was downstairs there is no air conditioning no wardrobe as described on the site The room was too small and short We could not sleep because of the heat and there was only one small window which is not enough In the morning they changed the room again not from the picture I could not recommended 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The building facade gave a complete misrepresentation of the property inside Three floors with narrow staircase and no lift What staff there were not overly helpful and showed little enthusiasm The breakfast room was minute and basically in the cellar with poor ventilation The kitchen was a small room in the cellar and the smell of the cooking was transposed throughout the building the juice fruit and milk containers we re placed tightly together on top of a cupboard along with coffee warming machine The breakfast was not attractive and everything was swimming in grease The bedroom on the third floor was in need of a good spring clean the nets were filthy the floor sloped from one corner to the opposite wall Overall not worthy of 2 stars at the most definitely not 4 star as advertised
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The extra small room gets so hot in the summer No air con and a tiny fan that wasn t high enough to reach me was terrible 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The price was too much for the standard of the hotel The bed was very hard and uncomfortable Breakfast was ok bacon was like rubber overall not impressed
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very dusty small and cramped single room Overpriced by any western standards I understand that people will always book a room in Bloomsbury for what APPEARS to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere The name and the photos of the ad are really misleading I can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but I really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lock on the door An airco that only runs for 120 minhtes 30 celcius that week Broken blinds Still charge 150 euro per night for 1 person Yet another hotel via Booking which doesn t bring what the website suggests 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The air con was not working until 5 in the evening and was about as good as an asmatic cat And as the room was on the top floor we were sweeting before we got to our room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms paint was a little tired but I believe the hotel are refreshing the rooms as we speak They were clean though

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very hot with ineffective or non existent air conditioning Very uncomfortable for sleeping with temps reaching 30 Celsius during our stay 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Basic functions if you travel alone with huge suitcases it will be a good chance to excesize because there is no porter to help you with luggage and there is no elevators in this hotel Single room is the smallest I ve ever seen Smaller than Japanese hotels even And no air con in the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I knew it was to be a small room but I could never ever imagine that the room was to be THAT small beyond joking it really was about 2x2 sqm It might have been perfect for a hobbit or a half man but it doesn t seem to be of a proper size for a human I also had to share this room with a spider on the ceiling but anyway it s summer and that poor creature didn t take much space The room has a bed if you re taller than 1 75m you may find it too small for you a table with tea coffee biscuits a cup a kettle an extremely small space for a shower toilet however there s just no place to drop one s luggage If you have just a laptop with you probably it s not a big problem but if you have a bag with your belongings the only place to put it is on the floor and either you aren t able to open the bathroom or you re not able to open the entrance door If you have a suite you need to keep fresh and ironed over the night there s no chance to do so in this room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was a little snug I mean my dogs kennel was bigger than this 1 5 meters x 6 meters with the double bed with it s brown stained duvet squeezed in at the end There was no bar so just a B B really
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was broken Room was microscopic Breakfast staff all dressed as if they d just come out of a fitness session and you had to stand around for a good few minutes before being noticed with one customer having to ask if he could be seated It s not like they were stupidly busy they were just pottering about and largely inattentive 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room incredibily small Just bed and you Noisy and hot No ventilation No fridge Rather B B standard not a hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The Wifi didn t connect There was no lift I didn t like the fact that the Breakfast room was on the basement floor it made it feel a bit Claustrophobic None of these are big issues for me just my thoughts 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room is too small there is not even a chair in the room The room is very noisy as the road there is through the window many cars and public transport This is very bad for sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel would make a lot of guests happy if they sold cold drinks in the reception
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I fall in the room when getting out the bathroom because had to step down 15 cm and the floor was very smooth and nothing to hold to After this incident an extra bathcloth from the hotel helped 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisy due to the street and bad windows Doors making too much noise when closing My room was too tiny even nothing for putting my clothes It was cold and I did not manage to set the heater or it was simply not working The bed sheet at one day was dirty At breakfast the coffee was quite bad and never ready at 7 30 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, See above Double bed in room GL3 was far too narrow for a couple My partner had to sleep in the single bed Lucky we had a triple What would he have done otherwise 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Traffic ruined my sleep That us the number one necessity of booking a hotel room The hotel staff knew that the window is not double glazed and yet I was put into the room The breakfast was like a factory production line I shall not book the hotel again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Do not under any circumstances book the small single room this is room G2 This is literally a store cupboard with a short bed crammed into the corner and a tiny wet cell for a bathroom I m not the tallest person 5 5 165cm but the bed in this room was far too short even for me I also had to move it away from the wall a little bit as this is an outside wall mostly of the wall is a drafty window actually and as a result absolutely freezing Even with the bed nudged away from the wall I still woke up with a raging headache as there was a draft from the window all night and any part of me that was not covered by the duvet was cold and damp This house would also do well with stocking up on WD 40 The door hinges creak squeak and whine rather loudly Something that being in room G2 you will not be able to avoid witnessing The room is adjacent to the door leading to the breakfast room and for some reason someone kept going in and out of it until 2 30am and then again from around 6 30am onwards It doesn t take a genius to work out how much sleep I actually got With the room also being under the stairs definitely not in a cute way like in Harry Potter and just opposite the hotel entrance you will hear all the comings and goings no matter how quiet the minority of people try to be If it s not their footsteps or voices waking keeping you up it will be the squeaky doors As for the bathroom I was amazed at the outstanding water pressure of the hand held shower head Unfortunately the physical size of the actual shower can t quite cope with the masses of water shooting out of the shower head so you will be flooding the bathroom even if you re conscious of it and try had to avoid it Consequently you ll be flooding the bedroom too so make sure to move everything off the little floor space there is around the bed before you attempt to shower 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was quite small for 2 adults and 1 child The room was in basement so there was no view available from the room The breakfast was available only for 1 30 hours from 7 30am For those on leisure holidays with children find it too less a time Secondly there were not many options to order for breakfast We got the room after 2 00pm despite requesting for an early checkin

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Regarding my particular room it DID have an en suite bathroom but it was so small that I could barely turn in the bathroom which didn t bother me but could bother someone more claustrophobic My room was on the first floor at the back with a direct door to the garden awesome so it was relatively quiet However the room is right next to the stairs to the breakfast area so in the morning there was noise and the room smelled of food 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Short staffed on first day felt sorry for the ladies Was very busy 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room is small as expected However there is neither a chair nor a stool to sit on Only the bed There is no ventilation in the room but they did provide a fan The fan had a 2 hour time limit I d wake up every two hours or so feeling very warm and then turn the fan on again There is no place to put your items when you unpack There are ample electrical connections but they are hard to access Make sure to bring the bulky plug converters that are needed to use US plugs in the British receptacles 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast which they advertise is included is very narrow in options Also even though they say it ends at 9 00 during weekdays they were starting to clean up at 8 15 There was NO COFFEE which is I think the least you can provide in any breakfast I had selected a table and after standing up for grabbing a fruit I came back to my table to find that the toast I was about to eat had already been taken away I stood up for less than 1 minute 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny bit more space in room would have been a bonus 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noise was the worst room gave onto a busy 3 lane road with poor sound insulation so it was continually noisy The room was tiny No table of any kind for a laptop or eating anything No fridge A single bed with a narrow space to one side of it so narrow I struggled to get my clothes in and out my modest sized suitcase The bathroom was very tiny miniscule washbasin with almost no space for toiletries 2 small towels with a small peg on the door There was no aircon but a fan was provided 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dirty room No air conditioning and no windows that opened Tiny rooms Far too small for comfort Would have moved hotels if for the fact that I would have lost my money 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel room It was tiny The bedside table glass cover was dirty with finger prints of another person The roman blinds looked dirty and were dusty The images online made the rooms look modern clean and spacious 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just one little point breakfast time from Monday till Saturday was till 9 00 and on Sunday till 9 30 only Coming for the weekend trip to London it was a little bit too short till 9 00 or till 9 30 I expected breakfast time at least till 10 00 and didn t notice that info though there was a notice of that in the room and on Saturday we were late at 9 18 and just had a short time to get cornflakes Even the tea was not available And when I have asked a lady to give me 2 black tea bags she told me it is not possible too late after I insisted she with a very unfriendly face opened a cupboard and gave me 2 tea bags That was my only negative comment about that hotel All the rest was great and a very good value for money 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Net curtains didn t look clean I couldn t get the room to go cool and I couldn t open the window

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bathroom was a little too small
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, breakfast was okay and breakfast service was poor too short staffed and not polite we had no welcome when we arrived we had to wait on the stair well for 15 minutes with 5 other people to be seated as there were not enough tables to cater for the amount of people just 20 minutes before breakfast was over at 9 pm which we felt was a little early for the weekend Not a word was spoken to us by the waitresses apart from when we were seated English breakfast and scrambled egg or fried manners and politeness cost nothing 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was only enough for one cup or tea in the room There was also only one large towel available and not enough toilet roll The breakfast room was very hot and crowded Hotel in general was very warm

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bedrooms so small No indication of this in hotel information No air conditioning supplied with 3 fans which reflects the temperature of the room Breakfast room good but again far too small for the number of guests Bit of an uncomfortable stay

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a room near the breakfast room Staff were speaking so loud at 6 30 in the morning that it woke us up Also the noise of guests and crockery was loud so we didn t get much sleep This room should not be used as a bedroom as it s far too close to the dining area Altogether very disappointed with our stay and bad value for money

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The only disappointment was that there was no lift 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our bed sloped downwards on 1 side Could do with a menu on the breakfast tables to know what was on offer The meat on the full English could be a bit more generous 1 slice of bacon and 1 small sausage
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The brown carpet and window frames need updating It needs to keep up with the hotel 2 doors down with its standards and decor Other guests need to be mindful of not slamming the doors at night perhaps reception should mention this during check in The receptionist had a welcoming smile unlike the staff at breakfast I m aware its early but please smile and acknowledge your guests

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My blind in my room didn t work and my window did not shut there was a safety window in front so it wasn t cold but it was very noisy I understand it was central so a busy road but if the window shut I m sure it would have been quieter Also they say there is a place to leave luggage after check out if your not leaving until later it s just next to the reception desk no private room and no luggage tickets you just leave it there under your own will which is not stated I paid and left it safely at kings cross 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had a single room which was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in it was ridiculous Thankfully only needed it 8pm until 8am There wasn t anything to hang clothes on apart from the door handle No wardrobe There wasn t any room to put my case apart from on the floor next to the bed which meant jumping over it to get to either the door or bathroom only one step would mean you were at both There was some form of sealed external door behind the bed which presumably used to go outside which meant there was a draft at the head of the bed This meant changing and sleeping at the other end of the bed The bathroom layout which meant if you were unfortunate enough to have to sit on the toilet you would also have to watch out for hitting your head on the sink The hotel itself seemed fine The single room unfortunately itself was the size of a cupboard and I definitely wouldn t recommend 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No hot water in the morning told receptionist they said they will sort it out so we decided to go down for breakfast but there was no room so had to go back to hotel room and wait while waiting they said water is back working but ours was not so tried again to go down for breakfast still no room or hot water and then it was was time to leave so we wasn t very happy as we had our child with us 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room but not a problem
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Loo could have done with some bleach around the rim 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Being woken up at 4 30 5am by staff preparing breakfast and talking very loudly outside of my room I had to tell them to be quiet 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We waited a good 5 mins at reception with no one there despite ringing the bell 3 times My room G2 was a cabin I could touch the walls with my arms outstretched I m just under 6 foot tall My feet were hanging off the bottom of the bed my head almost touched the shower head The view outside was of some old sofas and an aluminium ladder dumped outside It was right next to the extractor fans so I was woken by those starting at 0700hrs and then everyone having to walk past my door to get downstairs to the breakfast room I know the rate is only 75 night but these days that can get you a decent Premier Inn Not impressed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The full English was cold The coffee was stewed where it had been standing
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was small but was fine for one night Bathroom was also small and tap didn t work properly but had a great shower 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I got lost one night had to ring the hotel to find out what bus to get back to the hotel as the tube had stopped but the receptionist didn t know The shower temperature was piping hot a little to hot for comfort didn t seem to change no matter which way i twisted the temperature knob the bathroom was small and compact but acceptable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We missed breakfast because it finished at 0930 a slightly later time would have been good but we have nothing that we didn t like and for the price it was excellent 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Window wouldn t stay open for fresh air but there was a fan in the room that we used
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel is clean but scruffy from the dead flowers in the reception area to the marked walls and frayed carpets Outside our window was of a back yard of weeds and old sofas Staff were polite but not really friendly 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room cold dark Broken tap sink shower door didn t close properly Only one cup supplied for tea coffee second cup not available when asked 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel decor is very worn and looking very tired Could do with a coat of paint and new interior accessories The breakfast was very poor Bacon was covered in oil and so was the plate the cooked breakfast was cold They served one breakfast then it was a 5 minute wait before the rest was served Not good at all
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Don t be put off by the small breakfast room get there early as the breakfast is lovely 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Cracked tiles in bathroom toilet could have been cleaner curtain hanging off rail in bedroom camp bed not very comfortable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was in a poor state of repair I chose the normal single room and it was tiny so the small single room must be microscopic Most hotels of this price range give a bottle of water not here Window was broken meaning it was cold and road noise was terrible blind was also broken meaning morning light streamed in and it looked like it could fall down at any minute Breakfast may have been good but the breakfast room was so small that on both occasions I went down it was packed and getting a seat looked to be a good 10 minute wait Short time frame for serving breakfast too meant even going down at the start of service 7 30 was tight for getting to my work 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast in the basement was unbearably hot and very busy so had to wait for table when in a hurry
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The kitchen breakfast staff was unfriendly The room was literally tiny The bed size was non standard single It was suitable for young child really Need a headboard too 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was A LOT smaller than expected from photos The room was extremely hot and I had a hard time sleeping even though it is February and was cold outside 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a basement room on a busy road The traffic was really noisy all night The bathroom was tiny 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Well I first booked a single room That room was too small had no desk and it was very noisy street noise were beyond imagination So I asked the hotel staff to locate me to another room so the did after the manager approval to a double room Which I think was a positive gesture of them 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Multiple issues two examples 1 The lock on the door did not work so I had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst I slept on it to make sure no one came in 2 On the Saturday afternoon I was there I came back in the middle of the day to be told I was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving 3 large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was OK or even telling me this was going to happen When I asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on Sunday morning after I had vacated the room because I was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another 15 minutes past They left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room is small almostthe bed will not fit in no chair nor even a proper place for the luggage 3rd floor 60 stairs no lift
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room so small road outside noisy but in fairness i knew both these things before i booked the room breakfast very good
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The tiny room that I stayed it was very hot and uncomfortable And the breakfast didn t have many options just a couple of cereals and coffee 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Service was a bit informal bordering on awkward but still wasn t a big issue 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, What was there not to like 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed bugs having to leave the hotel at 4am in the morning on the first night and walk to a sister hotel with mice and being charged for the horrific experience no sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room was a little too small for all the people to eat at the same time 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was extremely small It was cold in the room as well The door in the room did not work very well Some members of staff were unwelcoming talking foreign language in front of me Others were very helpful Breakfast starts not until 7 30 which I can t comment on as I was unable to attend 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just a little too small No space to put case in room Breakfast room packed so full with tables and chairs it was difficult to move round safely 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Front facing rooms still get a lot of traffic noise and the dining area was quite warm as its in the basement
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed and sofa bed were exceedingly uncomfortable The sheets were clean but stained Had to ask for extra bed linen for the sofa bed The tap and toilet roll holder was loose The staff serving breakfast seemed grumpy and just a small smile would have been nice 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, First of all it is not a hotel of more than 2 people in a room Why I was travelling with my family mum and dad and we took the family room My bed was a sofa bed half broken and a very thin mattres on it which its not even suitable for camping When we told the receptionist she told us do not worry You just sleep and you will go out and also when i need it cups for coffee she said this is not my job and she gave us like by force also note that this hotel does not have elevator sobif you have heavy laguages it will be difficult for you to get up the stairs Our room was downstairs so we could listen screaming and footsteps all the time walking i do not recommend it sorry 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel doesn t have a lift and when I asked the receptionist if there was one because we had 3 baggages he just answered no and he didn t offer to help us The curtains were ripped and dirty blood stains 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It should be illegal to rent rooms this size to people i couldn t even move around and there was a breeze coming out of my window on the side of my bed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There s no lift not a complaint just a fact you might want to consider 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was so small for 75 it was like a broom cupboard Should not be allowed and customers should be warned before they book and pay up 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, If you would like an accurate picture of the room do you remember Harry Potter s room under the stairs at Dudley s house Precisely that was my room No consideration for a late check out
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room those at front of building are very noisy
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The shower was too hot and couldnt make it colder so having a shower was a bit of a performance also road noise was quite loud as my room was right next to busy main road but i used to live next to a railway line and so i learnt to shut the noise out 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Much better soundproofing in the windows I could hear the traffic as loud as I d I were on the street Better blinds the room was flooded with light from the street lamps as there were large gaps either side of the blind Better bedding the duvet and bed sheet were too small for the bed and the pillows too flat If these were addressed the room could become fantastic 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, curtains were very dirty room at street side with bed positioned against window make me feel like cars were driving over me Forgotten earplugs and none available at reception breakfast staff dressed like they came straight out of bed small bed for 2 persons 140cm 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It s certainly not a four stars hotel Only 90 minutes for breakfast late start at 7 30 and early finish at 9 00 Without lift Very small rooms Poor staff 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast was awful the service was slow and uncommunicative the full English breakfast was appalling and worst I have ever had It consisted of cold toast put down before breakfast order without plates or cutlery etc over done egg grey mass which I can only assume were mushrooms one piece of bacon which was fatty baked beans a tomato and a sausage which was surprisingly nice The other breakfast products yoghurt cheese milk cereal etc provided were set out on the side under light and were not chilled The staff were distant and unwelcoming at times Our room was entered just after popped out after we first arrived which made us feel uneasy The shower was extremely small the en suite door handle broken the fan was full with dust and the shower products provided were that of 1950 rose and lavender 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel and rooms uncomfortably hot too noisy with window open hike up 3 flights of stairs not great Didn t really see staff very much overall disappointed with hotel feel I could have got better for a little extra cost wouldn t stay again
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Uninterested and lacked friendliness staff customer services needed developing E g Upon arrival staff to busy eating breakfast or on phone Breakfast staff just lacked a welcome and direction for guests 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very very small room for single literally only enough space for a single bed Room s curtain could not be closed and next to the road traffic can get a bit distracting when trying to sleep Usual selection for english breakfast which was okay not great 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The double glazed window in my room was broken It wouldn t shut so the room was cold and the street noise horrendous The general standard of maintsinence was poor the door handle to the bathroom was hanging off the tap was loose and the bedroom door didn t lock The paintwork throughout is dirty
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As all door etc were all painted with Matt white paint they showed up all grubby hand marks This shouldn t put anyone off but hopefully the hotel will rethink its paint finishes and give them a wipe regularly 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Only one thing if you book a small single room assure you do NOT get the one next to the breakfast room It is a converted corridor and there is no room for your suitcase unless you put it on your bed But I am used to small rooms so I could live with that however since it is a converted corridor it has giant windows that leak cold air The space heaters could not keep up with the cold air plus the cold air rushed in just a bed level so it would nearly be impossible to ever sleep w o freezing My stay was in January The staff nodded knowingly and w o issue moved me to a different room
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of the bathroom was too small felt uncomfortable when staff were talking in their own language
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was so small I felt claustrophobic was even smaller than an easyHotel room I ve paid 19 for in central London Was way too hot too phone didn t work and so called reception from my mobile to tell them I needed the air conditioning on and they said it was disabled for all of winter and to open my window Room was overlooking busy road so couldn t sleep a wink terrible night 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Unfortunately the room did not match the pictures I saw online The double bed was very small the room was small and stuffy within the lower ground level The condiments had not been replaced and the bathroom sink had broken The staff seemed friendly but where not very helpful when we needed their assistance 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room was not window area and bathroom clean shower temp could not be regulated and tap loose no gluten free bread
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No complaints here 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The staff could have been friendlier However was good money and great location close to train station and walking distance for everything else 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel is so hot your feel suffocated Air con didn t work in the room therefore had to open the window which meant the road noise was pretty bad throughout the night
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had a single room with bed under the window no headboard so couldn t sit up in bed Breakfast room was small and cramped and a number of guests were stood in the doorway and corridor waiting for a table
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shower didn t work room was very noisy and the blinds wouldn t close so was light as well quite dirty thick layer of dust on the bed side table and blinds were filthy 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Communications prior to arrival went ignored The room allocated was cold and fit for hobbits only A shower that low you couldn t stand under it if your over 5 7 a bathroom mirror that gave you a view of well your chest only Plug sockets that are positioned that you have to wedge plugs in with a bent wire in order to use things A breakfast room that is not even close to being big enough having a breakfast end time of 9am and having customers having to queue up at the door was appalling And tinned mushrooms Really 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room could touch both walls at same time No lock on door Door leading to outside behind bed which is unnerving at night Only plug sockets were behind safe difficult to reach Toilet and shower were in a cupboard Dreary room not cleaned properly stained curtains 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was a bit dusty Window was right next to the bed but didn t close all the way Right next to the street and very loud Could smell cigarette smoke through the walls windows Breakfast is only until 9am very early No one available to help carry luggage up down stairs TV remote didn t work and staff didn t fix the issue Uncomfortable pillows bed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of rooms temperature controls in the room and hallways were non existent within minutes of having a shower on the morning it felt like I needed another and it was cold outside Room size was poor it was hard to iron a shirt given the size of the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, very poor breakfast The second day I went for breakfast at 9 00 actually a bit before 9 and they didn t serve me because they close at 9 00 The room wasn t hot enought Very bad intentet connection
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Facilities we stayed there as a group and the hotel doesn t have lift so we carry our big bags all the way to our room by stairs in second floor and I asked the reception if they can help us and her answer just no 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift and the single room is on the top floor Noisy No desk in the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Booked 7 nights at the hotel As soon as I arrived I smelled the dust and mold from the carpet Fortunately we spent most of our time outside but I still got a severe allergy on the 5th night with a blocked nose and sinus The cleaning staff also forgot to replenish the hand soap almost everyday 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, They need ventilation in the breakfast room When you go to have breakfast it smells greasy After breakfast my clothes smelled very bad 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My small single was not as described and paid for it was a cold blocked off back passage with locked half covered external back door with no key or bolt I was afraid someone could unlock the door from the outside The bed was a child s bed with no headboard jammed up against the door There was a small side table no chair desk wardrobe luggage rack iron board hairdryer in fact at 5 4 I could touch both sides of the room simultaneously and only just fitted in the bed Luckily I only had a small cabin sized wheelie case and handbag because it would not have been possible to bring a large case in to the room Thank goodness I was slim enough to slip in to the tiny ensuite also Unfortunately the room was in need of repair and redecoration too The male receptionist was quite unsympathetic and had no idea why I was not happy with the room The hotel was full so I could not be allocated another room room booked weeks prior At 11pm at night he suggested I could go and try and find another hotel He didn t offer to help me and of course I would have had to pay for this corridor Overall terrible experience never to be repeated You have been warned 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were put in a ground floor room This was very strange No windoes apart from an old wooden door with paint chipped off it which opened into a tiny concreted area full of leaves The bed wasn t the comfiest very hard Although the bedroom area was nice enough the other part of the room which was up some stairs and you had to duck under an arch to get to it I am quite tall and this could pose some problems if nipping to the toilet in the night There was dust on the dressing table area like it hadn t been cleaned in a while The breakfast wasn t what I would call a full English With one rasher of bacon and one sausage some scrambled egg and beans and a fried tomato We were starting for 2 nights however we didn t get up for breakfast on the second morning It is only served until 9am also which I found a little early if you ask me 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1st room was tiny ridiculously small for a twin on the front by noisy road This was unacceptable Thus we were given the basement room a little larger but still on roadside The stairs were creeky and adjacent door slamming was inappropriate Also linen delivery was thrown from the street to outside our room window below early morning giving a heavy body thud noise This was not pleasant We Shouldn t have to wear ear plugs in Hotels 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Everything was fine no complaints 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The extra bed pull out in the 3 bed room My friend said it wasn t comfortable The double bed was absolutely fine
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bathroom a little small but clean and heater aircon not working Lots of stairs for third floor 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A triple room is a double with an extra squeaky bed prized in No space to get to kettle or to use dressing table Freezing cold room with very draughty windows and a heater that is luke warm 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The cleanliness was rather poor Found hairs in our bed walls had mug splotches on and hotel was rather slacking when it came to being clean The blind was broke so couldn t see out the window and there were stains in the toilet At breakfast there wasn t a lot of choice unlike most hotels but was okay 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, First room we got was very small you could only get out of bed from one side after some discussion we were booked to a bigger room at the back side of the hotel
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I booked a small single room but this is an exaggeration compared with what I actually got The room was literally a converted store cupboard The bed was not even a full size single bed Shower leaked and very noisy Far too expensive for a male shift hotel room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was particularly small for 3 people and I m pregnant Additionally we had towels in our bathroom that were already soiled and had to have the kettle cleaned 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel was very hot in fact we had our windows open all night in December all in all it did have the facilities that were advertised but it didn t feel like a 4 star hotel
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room size was incredibly small Also I think the bed I slept in was a child s bed as my toes were hanging off the end and I m only 5 5 Place in need of a refurb as looked a bit rundown overall 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small bathroom but still OK The breakfast is good but only if you stay 2 3 days only Then it will be boring always the same full or not full English breakfast 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was clearly not a room it was a lobby to the garden where they put a bed 80x170cm which obviously was a sofa and not a bed Located on one of the landing in the staircase the room was noisy and not comfy at all the bathroom was a cupboard where I could barely stand I travel a lot for business and that room was far way the worst I ve ever had 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the the room smelled like an ashtray especially after you get out of the shower and the steam fills the room the single room is so small that you can t even open your bag
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Never ever accept room lg4 It is between the dining room and kitchen It is very noisy smells of cooking and the room temperature is uncontrollable Really awful 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing It exceeded our expectations 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There are tiny rooms there are train compartments and there are Bloomsbury Palace rooms There was a recess for the bed with a 30 cm space on the side It was my first visit to London so I don t know this is perhaps local standards but I have never been anywhere close to a hotel room this small It was OK since I this time only needed a bed but the room description says there would be a writing desk which there wasn t It couldn t possibly have fitted in There wasn t even room to tuck away your luggage You had to place it on the floor thereby blocking either the entrance door or the door to the bathroom My computer which I had to use in bed had to be stored under the bed I estimate the total floor area to less than 2 square metres making up a narrow corridor from the door to the bed Accurate information about exactly how small the rooms are would be honest to give customers the chance to make an informed decision The cleaning under the bed and other hard to reach areas was so so I guess it s hard for the cleaners to vacuum such a small room where there s barely any space to move around your equipment The curtains were torn and had black fringes Sheets and bathroom were clean though I never tried breakfast since there was a long queue of people waiting to be seated and no tables available There were several nice coffeshops in the neighbourhood however so I didn t go hungry 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had to wait for breakfast as dining room was too small Luckily I was not on a deadline to leave before a table became available Also breakfast bar coffee and juice was cleared whilst we were still sitting there 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, not disable friendly at all We had to go up three flights of stairs with our suitcase as I am 69 yrs old with arthritis I found this quiet hard wouldn t stay again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was kept waiting on departure as no one was at reception receptionist was in front doorway chatting to someone and smoking Although she was friendly when returning to reception and apologised for my wait it is not good enough service 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was very old fashioned with brown carpets and everywhere needed to be painted the net curtains in the bedroom looked dirty for the price I paid and the number of stars I was expecting a lot better The rooms were very small and the bathrooms were tiny Breakfast tasted good but the dining room wasn t great not much room and very dark 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was very tiny and although I knew the bed was small as I was notified I wasn t expecting it to be that small Also no space for your clothes just 1 small peg to hang one item However I did not spend much time in the room so it was fine and the staff very helpful Would stay here again
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As we were travelling as a family of 3 our bedroom was ok but very small Very small breakfast room and had to wait for an available table so you could end up waiting in line There was a bedroom next door in the basement that could have been used to extend the breakfast room There is no hotel bar only a sofa in reception if you wanted to relax outside of your room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Didn t like the Lower ground floor room basement with a window that looked out onto a brick wall would have liked a view Very small double bed and although site mentions a variety of double bed sizes when I asked was told hotel only had the one size double bed Small compact size of double room and equally small bathroom 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Including Palace in the hotel name appears somewhat overdone since rooms and overall space in the hotel are overall cramped 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Not suitable for elderly as there is no lift Carrying the luggage on the staircase can be very tidieous 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dealt with some ongoing noise late into the night from above room that was not hotels fault and they tried to remedy it after I asked and had a faulty heat ac unit in room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was in a bottom floor single room and it was more like old and run down back utility room which had a door and a full room length large widow to the back Also there was no headboard well unless you include the back door as one As a result this room was freezing I can t understate how bad his room was and can t believe that they are using it as a room I only stayed approx 2 hours as it was so uncortable and cold they had no other rooms available but did allow me to checkout without any charge found another hotel around the corner 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was aware the single bedroom would be small but not as tiny as it was This I could have been happy with but for half the price It was certainly not value for money and the bed proved very uncomfortable as well with springs poking into me The room was clean and the location is fantastic but I would think twice booking this hotel given the broom cupboard size of the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, everything was so disgusting that i d go for expedia next time 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I got a really small room like s closet When I asked for another room I got one that was underground It was bigger but between the kitchen and the tiny restaurant This was super noisy and it smelled like a kitchen In the morning I had to wait in order to find a table for my breakfast and generally there was no space for anyone The breakfast was of low quality and it was served until 9 I had to do check out at 10 30 The only positive thing was the location I wouldn t recommend it to other visitors 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room allocated to me on the ground floor was previously a hallway The converted room was so small with a locked glass door to the garden The adjacent shower room was extremely tight There was a floor grip where attempts had been made to stick it down ehich in my view was a trip hazard The receptionist did not tell me breakfast isn t served after 9 00 Therefore I missed it Staff were not particularly concerned This had been sold by booking com as 4 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms and overall hotel in need of refurbishment definitely not 4 star Net curtains in the bedroom dirty window wouldn t stay open no runner cracks above doorway large gap between bottom of the door and floor lock on door didn t work as the plate in the frame was in the wrong place the list goes on 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I had was really small and had a big step into and from the toilet that was dangerous the walls where cracked 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The condition of the room was very poor There were cracks in the walls and the pictures at booking com did not match with the room According to booking com they were suppose to re imburse 50 but it was not paid by the deadline set by booking com 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Stayed in smallest room I have ever seen small single which seems to have been a porch or fire escape corridor with a door each end of bed could touch far wall whilst lay in bed Noisy with kitchen fans but did the job for a very brief stay
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Two flights of stairs asked for help with my luggage No sorry The room was a shoe box Hooks on wall for clothes one power point under a shelf jammed between bed and wall Had to kneel on floor to find it Blind did not work I asked to be moved and was put on the ground floor I carried my bags down the stairs Slightly larger room with a wardrobe and 2 power points jammed under shelf between bed and wall The air conditioning didn t work because it was a weekend no one to fix it I was given a fan When I made a cup of tea no spoon I was fed up stirred my tea with my pen Very disappointed waste of money 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The ground floor room G5 was pokey and oddly shaped and facing on to Gower St at ground level it was really noisy The UCL Hospital is just up the road and while it is comforting to be close to such a centre of excellence the noise and frequency of emergency ambulances going past was a bummer 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The website clearly states a double room has a double bed What we got was two singles pushed together with two single duvets Whenever we rolled towards the middle the beds separated I consider this a misrepresentation as I would not have booked this hotel had I known the truth We asked very nicely at reception to change rooms after the first night to be told we couldn t I had to ask by email their complaints procedure to have our room changed which they clearly weren t happy about and I still feel the website should be changed and I m unimpressed I didn t receive what was promised on night one 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisy being in basement next to kitchen and room was too hot and too isolated for solo traveller query rodent scratching around at night time
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was way smaller than i expected I had problem with placing my luggage in the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room we stayed in on the ground floor was quite grubby and a bit musty There wasn t a full curtain only a blind which was broken at the top and was filthy The bed was clean and comfy It is ok for 1 night but I wouldn t stay any longer and don t believe the ratings as it is definitely not a 4 hotel more like a 2 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, staff were terrible hotel is filthy blind didn t pull down and net curtains were so dirty they were black and not white it is so easy to take down nets to wash so not sure why they don t staff were unhelpful when I complained that the double lock on my door didn t work 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Allocated a room on the basement floor next to the kitchen Not only did the room smell and very filthy hairs in the shower sticky carpets and dust the walls were not sound proof Hence it felt as thou you were staying in the kitchen itself 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, In view of the keen price and all the good points I accept the restriction in room size Quite acceptable for a short stay Thank you I shall certainly return 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was extremely small It was impossible to open the bathroom door without having to move the luggage first I spent a lot of time moving my luggage and changing things of place just to reach the bathroom or the room door The room has everything mentioned in the booking but there is no enough space to put everything there Over the bedside table is the safe box over the safe box is the tray with the coffe cups etc and inside the bedside table drawer is the telephone unplugged The room was very cold It has been a hall to the back yard now closed two doors and a big window not warm at all It doesn t has a good heater The heater available was not good enough and I froze The second morning they have had a problem in the kitchen and there were no hot food The variety of cold breakfast didn t change It was the same I would expect a bigger variety of cold things if they can t serve the traditional English breakfast proposed in the booking I have considered to change hotel after the first night but the payment was made in advanced and I didn t try This tiny and dysfunctional room should be cheaper I would not return to this hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was noisy at night next to the stairs extremely small no room to move in the shower The breakfast room was small and crowded
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The small room was infinitesimally small Prisoners in solitary confinement have better accommodation Smelly just above kitchen Noisy straight on front of front door onto street and traffic passes to lower ground floor and breakfast room and noise from rooms above It appeared to be little more than a cupboard The ensuite was even smaller Try sitting on the look with the minute sink on your boob and trying to wash in the sink was dreadful When I complained i was fobbed off and felt forced to spend the night because without a refund I couldn t go elsewhere It was my worst nights sleep ever and breakfast was as bland as the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very poor breakfast if you don t go for a full English Shower not made for persons taller than 185cm
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was good but room far too small for either guests or staff to move around too many people needed to eat in a very small space
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very small and dusty around the window where the blind didn t work No one had bothered to look behind it in a long while The rest of the room and bathroom was very clean
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was the size of a cupboard with not enough room for a desk or chair this made it very difficult for me as I was in London on business and needed the evening to prepare my work I was forced to work uncomfortably in the reception area I had a cold and poor nights sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room 205 small single Room was only as long as the single bed and floor space approx 2 x 6 Ensuite tiny but clean Room was on a half landing so staircase directly outside bedroom door which meant I could hear everyone coming and going Door didn t lock although accessed only on key card wifi signal didn t reach room no mattress protector on bed just a thin sheet with blood stains see photos Net curtain was a grubby grey and roman blind was dusty where it hadn t been hoovered for a while Head end of bed right next to window so very draughty all night Decided not to sample the breakfast after reading reviews so went to Euston Station instead 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Curtain was broken Staff didn t fix it seemed disinterested Effectively slept on an ledge in front of an open window for 4 nights facing a busy street Also their internet was unusable half the time so i had to find coffee shops to do work For the price per night totally unacceptable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, All the rest We were in the lower ground room LG5 which feels damp smells of tobacco and looks like a badly converted cellar The room and the whole experience was probably worth 40 less than the price we paid 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was really hot air conditioning didn t work but we were given a fan we had two single beds pushed together rather than a double bed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I stayed in the hotel for 2 days The heater in room did not worked for both days despite complaining about it since first day Due to this i had clod and flu The room is very very small and there is no space to even stand in the room Wifi signals were too weak and room was very dusty

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room quite small but ok and I would not quite say this is what we did not like just cant find anything else to say
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Hotel overall was fine unfortunately our room was awful G5 It was tiny nothing like any of photographs Noisy due to been on street level so constant traffic noise Dark and dingy with no space The bed was pushed up against window with a table next to it which you had to climb over to get into bed The tv was on the wall at the left side of the bed so impossible to watch Clearly a failed attempt at adding another room

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room bed not very comfortable bathroom no shelves or towel racks Also no elevator for lugging bags to 3rd really 4th floor

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I got was very small Insulation is not goo I heard all the noise coming from outside The heater was broken I asked to be fixed but somehow it was not I asked to change the room but there was no free one from the same category Then I asked to change to any other room even if I ve to pay for it so they ve upgraded my room for one night for free I was just disappointed because I though they should have taken these actions before I ask for it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The double bed was unbalanced so the person sleeping on the right side was in danger to fell off the bed Breakfast was ok but very limited in choices 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Dirty room mud stains on the walls and blind Ground floor room hardly any sleep due to the amount of noise Hard bed walls paper thin 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 when I checked in and after I paid the stuff told me that the room is in the underground floor I told the stuff to change it as I have a phobia but the stuff refused saying no other available rooms I told him that they should but that in the selection of the room as an option to agree to stay in underground floor or not to agree 2 I didn t like the way the stuff were answer your notes For example the main light in the room was not working When I asked he said you can use the beside bed ones 3 another example for the rudeness in the stuff I request for extra duvet the reception said they don t have and he asked me the reason why I need i and if I have extra people in the roomt This was very very rude question 4 My booked room was with full English breakfast I didn t like the breakfast at all There isn t any verity of food just value Even the bread I have to requested it from the waiter It was one of the worst breakfast I ever had 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This must be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in London I have stayed in a lot and I am at a loss why it is rated how it is Our room and particularly en suite was very dirty and grimy In addition the smell of grease and fried food permeates through the whole hotel every morning leaving your clothes in need of a dry clean We couldn t even open our window due to the smell coming up from the basement kitchen Don t let the photos on this website fool you as I did

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As a single female traveller I felt unsafe as door had no working lock The single room was also extra tiny Overall place is shabby and most certainly not 4 stars I Felt seriously misled by 4 star rating I did not stay in the end as thankfully found friend to stay with instead after seeing how dreadful this place truely is Don t be tempted by the price Whatever money you spend here is too much Please read the reviews on tripadvisor Do not book here

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was awful small dirty dingy with no air con Very poor value for money
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The net curtains were filthy there were mice in the wall and window box and I couldn t wait to get out of there Staff would not do me a packed lunch instead of breakfast really unhelpful Would not stay there again

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con in the room didn t work There was a fan and it was 20 degrees but in the stairway and the room it was too hot We had the fan on and window open 24 7 The stairs needed a hoover and the room needed a good clean as well Dust skirting boards 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I can t figure out how come this small hotel can be rated as 4 stars In most Asian countries even a 2 star hotel can be better than this one One terrible experience was by the last night when I stayed the toilet was stuck and I have to ask the receptionist to get me a pump to fix it Can you imagine this could happen in a 4 star hotel Besides the room G3 we stayed was equipped with a malfunctioned air con 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The heat in the room No air conditioning but a fan is provided for you but in the middle of a heatwave with window open no air was coming in to room at all Single rooms are really small compact

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The hotel was dirty the rooms were stifling hot and the fan didn t work The carpets didn t fit the floor meaning dirty floorboards were showing There weren t enough seats in the breakfast room for the number of guests meaning guests had to queue for breakfast Waitresses didn t speak very good English and could not understand basic requests for salt or sweetener I would not recommend this hotel at all 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Terrible management and service Let me list the ways A C was advertised as part of he room but actually broken during or entire stay The staff promised it would be fixed the next day but never was We were given two fans that did not cool our room right next to the kitchen downstairs We asked to move rooms but the staff promised they would look into it but never followed through They took our large bath towels one day and replaced them with hand towels because they did not get their laundry delivery Our ironing board had a burned cover Basically we should have gotten a discount or even a full refund for this awful experience 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, General cleanliness of the hotel was poor We didn t use the room tea coffee facilities as the kettle cups were dirty Had to complain about heavily stained towels

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift and put on top floor with 4 suitcases Do not attempt if you have difficulties walking No help even offered with luggage

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, nothing really if i had to out something it was that the room was a little warm when entering but fired up the air con and all sorted
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, As a solo traveller I booked a single room It was barely bigger than a cupboard Just the length of a single bed and about 6ft wide Don t ask for a small single room if you want a comfortable night 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were a bit hot And of course very small but that s London rooms for you

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was extremely small and being on the third floor extremely hot even though I was provided with a fan 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noise in the rooms at the front is horrendous It s like sleeping on a motorway And there is not even any double glazing There is SOOT on the window ledge due to the road pollution 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was a tick too small hardly any space for a very small bag Breakfast itself nice and good breakfast room too small not always seats available and after breakfast one has all beakfast smell in the clothes That s something what I do not like to smell the breakfast still all day long in hair and clothes 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The booking confirmation showed that room had air conditioning and a laptop safe safe deposit box It had neither unless you count a pedestal fan that sounds like an apache taking off as air conditioning and the safe was present but had no power looked like it had been broken into and was not affixed to anything All this was compounded by it being the hottest day of the year and the room displaying a sign that we leave our possession in the room at our own risk The cleanliness and quality of the rooms is nothing like the pictures The staircases are a hazard as individual steps are sinking and have not been repaired The beds are not remotely comfortable there are no satellite channels available on the TV as advertised and the cooked breakfast was disgusting grease fest stick to the cereal I only booked the place to be near Euston station but I ve rated location here based entirely on a tourism perspective There is nothing noteworthy nearby if you don t need to be in this area don t be 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Have booked the hotel for 3 pax a few months before checking in and put in a request for air conditioning summer and ground floor room else need an elevetor we had 6 luggages Instead we were given a room in basement two with 2 miserable fans because we were late in our check in Not acceptable as the booking was made much earlier and request was also put in then The room should have been reserved If not ground floor maybe in basement one The staff should have tried to accommodate our request and not give the reason as the hotel was full and we were late in checking in Worse still we stayed here for 2 nights and on the second night they removed a fan from our room We insisted that they replaced the missing fan as the room was very stuffy with no windows Overall stay was not good 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con didn t work Paid for three beds and got one double and the worst fold out bed ever it wasn t even made and when she came to pull it out it was dirty breakfast room was hot and dingy food wasn t great staff never communicated with you The communal garden had 20 bin bags of rubbish and looks like it s been abandoned 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was tiny for two people i woke up numb down one side from awkward sleeping pattern my partner was in constant fear she would fall out of bed we had to roll up a hand towel and stick in under the edge of her side of the mattress to create a safety ledge naturally this was removed after the 1st night by cleaning staff and then we were short changed the hand towel as well grrrrr This bed is for one person only its the smallest double bed in human history i felt tortured having to sleep in it Never staying there again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room number LG1 was extremely hot even with two air condition units on Double bed very small probably only 4 foot wide 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very basic for 4 stars Our room was in the basement which was really hot right next to the kitchen which was incredibly loud in the morning over the breakfast periods Seems expensive for what you get but I guess that s London 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lifts trying to get a large suitcase upto the third floor Doors banging from other rooms Ok for a couple of nights smsll bedroom
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 3 floors up with no elevator 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My single room would be better described as a broom cupboard with a bed Shower room washbasin too small for kettle to fit under

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Air con wasn t working and the room was an oven in a warm summer evening 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There were only a few negatives from our stay which included The occupiers of neighbouring rooms were not very considerate continually slamming doors and talking loudly in the small corridor outside our room The decor in the room was a little on the tired side with a window catch missing A very hot few days in London and the air conditioning not working in the room meant the windows had to be left open so the smell of breakfast cooking each morning was very strong 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The temperature in the room was too high summer time it was poorly air conditioned and it felt like I was in a sauna Because of that sleeping throught the night in this hotel was the worst part of my trip to London And it s a 4 star hotel Yeah right
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift in the hotel so u have to use the stairs the a c is very bad cause at that time the weather was hot we suffered alot no trash basket in the room no one can hepl u with the luggages 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room extremely small Not a single chair or small table to put your belongings simply there was no space I asked for another room and was told all were the same size Wifi did not work Had to come down to the lounge to have Internet
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the accommodation was not brilliant there is no lift in the building and arrival and departure were both trials to be endured thankfully i only had a 5 night stay so i put up with these shortcomings the mistake will not be repeated 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, breakfast was terrible in terms of comfort of the environment with a small room in the basement very hot and crammed with people the room was extremely small basically just a single bed surrounded by walls 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noisey on the road side of the hotel especially when hot as the windows needed to be opened to cool the room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No other facilities e g bar But wasn t a problem 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, More Maintence Runs in the carpet right outside of our door The faucet was loose and spun when you tried to push it to the hot or cold Caulking in the shower needs attention 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small it was claustrophobic The bathroom was barely big enough to fit in There was no air conditioning and the room was stiflingly hot It was on the street side so without air the window was open and it was noisy Really think how badly you want to stay here before booking English Breakfast wasn t what you d expect from a pub or anywhere else and was missing traditional elements 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was really cramped and it was really difficult to open a large suitcase in it no wardrobe just a tiny little shelf no air conditioning rather boring and limited breakfast menu either English breakfast or yoghurt no salads and the dining room gets really stuffy when filled with guests poor wifi connection
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room Very very noisy at the front of the hotel Window sash broken so I could not close the it and there was a very noisy generator and people working outside my window at night plus traffic Very little sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Waited at reception 10 15 mins for someone to return to the desk so I could check in Small single room was incredibly tiny like a shoe box Asked to upgrade but nothing bigger available Bed wasn t even a full size single no headboard on quite free wheels so slid around the floor a bit and crammed really close to the wall window sill Barely any floor space or room to hang store anything Had to hang clothes above the tea station Shower room very very small barely a cloakroom tiny shower not even full sized and a tiny cloakroom sized sink right next to the toilet Generally the room was finished to a very poor standard plaster chipping around the edges bare filler visible and needed a good lick of paint Laminate floor had suffered water damage hardly surprising in view of the proximity of the shower to the door into the bedroom Basically felt like a corridor cupboard that they ve tried to monetise and done a poor job of it if it had been finished to a better standard the size would have been easier to excuse All in all not what I expected from a genius recommendation I thought they were supposed to be great deals to reward loyal booking com customers not a punishment 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Size of the single room like a shoe box heating room was too warm Blind rail fell nearly hitting me on the head Room was incredibly noisy from the traffic 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The stair is probably a few hundred years old but is rickety and needs replaced I don t think there was a lift and I hauled my case up the stairs 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Facility needs a serious remodel except for the shower Carpet in room old why they have carpet in a hotel is beyond me Base flooring outside bathroom door was very uneven probable due to wood rot covered by carpet to disguise poor maintenance 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small room and unable to open the window Reception supplied me with a fan which made it bearable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This was probably the most pathetic excuse of a hotel room that I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some dingy places before The room was the converted former exit to the back yard and the hard floor showed obvious signs of water damage To top it off the bed was tiny only 170 cm long about 5 7 I m not tall but even so my feet were sticking out past the bed Clatter from kitchen and a noise from some electrical motor nearby made it impossible to sleep past seven in the morning If they put you in the tiny room half a set of stairs down from the entrance just say no The other rooms in the hotel might be ok but this room was just horrible 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were positioned in LG1 lower ground where people could see through the window should the curtains be open and we were lying in bed not a big problem BUT the main air con wasn t working and it seemed we had a standing air con unit next to the bed this air con unit generated more heat from the side than the cool air it could produce making the room a sauna we could open the window but have to keep the thick curtains closed for any sort or privacy meaning no cold air would pass through we were up several times in the night for cold showers SLEEPLESS NIGHT
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The kitchen staff need to wear hair nets Myself and my partner both had hair in our breakfast 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Why do you need to heat up the rooms to like 25 27 degrees and then use coolers to cool them down Suck a waste The cleanliness leaves a lot to wish for dusty and fithy walls Mattress ok but why not complete it with a decent mattress topper I could feel every spring in the mattress 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, single room was heading to the main street and therefor very loud additionally the room was somewhere overheated therefore it was necessary to open the window not a good combination with the street

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The beds were a little uncomfortable There was a problem with the door that needed to be fixed whilst we were there which was fine but they waited until we had come back into our room before they started to fix it
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small cabin room not good if u are tall or big No air con fan only which is uncomfortable given size of room and London was about 30 degrees

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Towels in the shower were small ok if you are a very slim person The breakfast room was very small cramped for the amount of guests that were staying 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast area should be bigger to accommodate all guests Some were kept waiting for tables which put pressure on those already seated to eat their breakfast quickly 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small I couldn t even put my clithes on properly it was part of the landing that got sectioned off and made into a room This was not fairly reflected in the booking process and the price was xomparable to other places I have stayed in where the room size was much better Breakfast was served in the basement with very little ventilation which made the breakfast hall unbearable to sit in No wi fi in rooms either which is atrocious 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A lot of stairs to get the the third floor The room door would not lock and the air conditioning was broken Hopefully both have now been repaired
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed not the greatest Decor a bit tired in some places but clean enough Small room and quite warm but fine for a couple of nights 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room crowded at time we went which was dangerous carrying hot tea coffee between tables with children there However still got fast service Breakfast good Room was very warm but air conditioner provided 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Was rather warm and a slightly better fan would have been handy but I hate the heat more than most 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was hardly bigger than a shoebox For GBP 100 night My feet were hanging off the bed and im not particularly tall 170 cm My room was made out of the way towards the backyard hence the shoebox had 2 doors My room was above the kitchen so i woke up for the smell of eggs and fried bacon i did not like it at all You get much more for value if u add 20 pounds and get a different place 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast logistics The order from table that took quite a while though the place wasn t crowded A buffet kind of breakfast is more my cup of tea 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was first put in basement room which felt like a dungeon I expected a small room but not to be in subterranean level Receptionist was nice and moved me to first floor I had no problems that room was even smaller than the first but there is no double glazing and the noise from the street was continuous I may as well had the bed on the pavement I could not sleep all night I would not recommend him at all 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single room was very small 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small It was literally a corridor turned into a room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A bit noisy being ground floor and fronting on to Gower Street but that was ok No temperature control in the room was a bit warm as are many hotels these days and didn t work out how to open the window although I probably wouldn t have due to the traffic noise 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had the room LG4 on the lower floor next to the breakfast room I booked a single room and I had a room with a proper double bed which was fantastic but as you can imagine I have been waken up at 6 00am because of the noises around the breakfast room That was extremely unpleasant So make sure to avoid this room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms could do with updating Staff being a bit more friendlier
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We thought we booked a twin room but apparently that was not true And the staff could do nothing to help us So my mom stayed in the single and I slept in a hostel near by I really wish there had been a manager or some kind of human treatment of us in this situation It left a bad taste in my mouth concerning our reservation 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, On the third floor no lift not disabled friendly bathroom cramped whole of upper floors sweltering hot breakfast area in basement and also too hot
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was tiny only place to sit was on the bed but the television was at standing eye night almost impossible to view from the bed without hurting your neck 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were in a small but clean room on the top floor There is no lift and therefore had to carry our case s up several flights of stairs The room was very hot and already had a fan tall on a stand and the air conditioning might as well have been non existent The weather outside was warm and obviously heat rises so it was like a sauna and very uncomfortable to sleep in if at all Our complaints were met with a smile and the engineer will be here tomorrow I actually met him and he said the air con was working but said to me what do you expect in the Summer I reminded him it was early May and the whole point of air con was to regulate the temperature to an ambient one The room cooled a little as the outside temperature got lower but not good 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The windows were filthy on the INSIDE see photo Could not open the window would have got covered in dirt while trying in any case and the room was too hot Asked them to open it when I went out but they didn t Curtain falling off rail so privacy poor Could hardly hear the tv at times due to traffic noise in a VERY small room tv at foot of the bed Nowhere to put case no room for a chair or table hardly room to stand up beside bed and get dressed Dining room too small so had to queue ages for breakfast Toast was not toasted just died up bread Their philosophy is Pack em in tight and charge a lot of money because we re in a good spot 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The inexpensive single room is on the top floor a long walk with a suitcase It s very small but was okay but the position of the safe made it hard to see almost on the floor and inconvenient to use Is there an outlet in the room itself I only saw and used the one in the bathroom but it was great that it took American plugs directly I came with an adapter but didn t need it Wish there had been a second set of pegs and more hangars for clothes since there s no closet But the arrangement in general is really efficient Only other thing a folding chair could hang on a wall peg and be used as needed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Lots to choose for breakfast however my full english was not great
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, How this hotel has 4 stars is completely outrageous It is hugely expensive to what you get I had booked a small single room and it was truly small Beside the small 80 cm single bed there was less than 80 cm floor space width The bathroom was actually no more than 60x120cm and had I not been a quite petite individual I would literally not been able to get into or turn in the tiny shower Good water pressure though 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Micro size room sleepless due to road noise poor room facilities no air cooling system Shower handles jammed not for disabled no sound proofing on walls or windows Window shutter jammed Poor blinds on window No space for suitcase No wardrobe for clothes 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room LG1 was a basement room below street level next to the Hotel ventilation which was noisy at night Not worth paying 140 Euros per night for such an accomodation 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room LG5 mould in bedroom and bathroom Paint peeling off walls of shower No proper shower screen Ants in bathroom following morning No ventilation only very old fans for any cool air Heating was left on in room on a very hot day making the mould situation worse 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I knew it was a small room but it was really no more than a cupboard I am only 1 63m and I could just about touch both sides of the room Also I could hardly turn around in the shower It was also far too hot and even with a fan provided by reception I had a poor nights sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A bigger bathroom would be nice although it was sufficient 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No complaints here 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Generally I don t like carpet on the floors but that very common in the UK and the internet was a little slow but that s also common in London so it s only a minor thing 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It is dated and is in need to revamping A little paint new carpets would go a long way to making this a far better hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The lack of air conditions The room that I was allocated was in the basement which also did not have any air conditions It was ok on a cold day but on a hot day I don t think it would be a very comfortable room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was small and it was very hot and i was lucky to have a fan in my room The bedding had a stain on it and the bathroom had pubic hairs on the floor The actual English breakfast was not good I would have my breakfast in a near cafe instead Bacon was like cardboard scrambled eggs didn t taste good and I left most of it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Lobby is not impressive at all When you walk in you do not feel like you are in a good place 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wifi was slow Room is small but was good for me as a single Noisy insulation is not that good
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single bedroom was so small and there were barely any space to put the luggage I had to put my luggage against the door to create more space in the room It felt like there were lack of design plan for storage space had been put into the room since putting the luggage against the door would be considered a safety hazard but it had to be done to be able to open the bathroom door The wall desperately needs to be fixed and the curtain needs a little bit of vacuum done Also I rarely saw any staff on the front desk which is kind of frustating when you need their immediate assistance 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was very small there is not desk or a table to put things or work if you are in business travel The room close to the street bit noisy the lobby very small you can not really sit there The curtains were dirty 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The entrance smelt of smoke The reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty Reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me The walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them No ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them The outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown Bathroom was TINY like 1 5ft by 2 5ft if that If I had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work I d have checked out before I checked in First impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift Breakfast room small First room on third floor was small and sloped Moved to basement room which was better 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very hot when I arrived The sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective The inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows I asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was I assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while I was out However they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night Made for a poor nights sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in had to move my bag around to move in the room Feet touched the wall in the bed Iron smoked when I turned it on Reception smelled of overpowering cleanly products Really noisy as the exterior window had been nailed open and there was just a single pane of extra glazing Uncomfortably hot Very pleased to leave in the morning 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was for 3 adults and a fold out bed had been put up unable to get to the tea coffee facilities which were behind the put up bed Window did not close properly and we were above the kitchen so everything smelt of bacon in our room from 6am 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wifi useless Breakfast service started 7 30 which is late when on business 7am would be better
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were incredibly small and beds for anyone over 5 8 foot was a problem Also I booked for two people and they charged my account even though I stated the two people were paying on departure 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff try their best in poor English No management visible or contactable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast served from 7 30 which seems a little late for business guests 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It would be hard going if we were older or infirm as we were on the top floor with steep stairs and no lift but this is a Victorian property and we enjoyed the charm and overall feel of the building 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift Traffic noise when the room is on the main road 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small and crammed area for breakfast Staff unable to understand what your menu choice was required for breakfast Insufficient room in bedroom 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed springs had gone on one side so the bed tilted and was very uncomfortable The plaster was chipping off the walls The blinds were dirty The bedside lamp was broken 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was terrible
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Mega tiny room Wasn t a single room Was smaller than a box room The hotel and room was boiling hot Was unable to turn heating off 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Had issues with the checking in Took over an hour to resolve with bloomsbury denying my reservation despite me having email proof from Booking Com and then asking to just purchase another room to deal with it in the morning as this was getting very late into the night with work the next morning Seemed very reserved to assist and then Booking com finally answered the phone to refuse any form of compensation Booking Com blaming the Bloomsbury palace and the Bloomsbury palace blaming Booking com Overall did not feel like a guest in the hotel and more a nuisance 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The noises outside of the traffic passing by was hard to ignore A good night s sleep was nearly impossible 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was indeed extremely small though I was prepared for it after having read reviews before booking I was travelling with a backpack so little space was not a major issue but those travelling with larger suitcases and planning to put their stuff around the room should think twice as there is really no extra space anywhere Also the room was a bit dusty 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room 105 was ludicrously small The wall was cold and given how small the room was I woke up every time I turned in bed The breakfast was mediocre poached eggs hard white sliced bread 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was too warm the window was jammed open so I couldnt close it and there was traffic noise all night 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It could definitely be more clean I couldn t say that it was dirty But I stayed for four nights and the sheets were not changed not even once There was an issue with the sink it was draining extremely slowly and as a result it was getting dirty very fast I have noticed that it wasn t cleaned either even if my room was made up The breakfast was offered for a very short time 7 30 9 00 so all the clients of the hotel were trying to get served on the same time The waitresses were doing their best but under such pressure of work and pressure of time their work was not easy at all Longer breakfast hours could make life easier both for the customers and the workers The room was extremely small not the smallest i have stayed to in London though And extremely hot The bed was OK but the furniture and deco was definitely tired And the walls too as you could see huge cracks from the top to the bottom 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The smallest room I have ever seen even in Japan In a traveller lodge I had a better room Nobidea how a 9 square meter room including bath cam be legal Small Dirty Awful 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, tiny bathroom room heater takes a long time to work hotel does not have luggage storage no elevator triple rooms would usually have 3 songle beds ours only has 2 single beds and 1 sofa bed phone is not working 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Double bed was a bit hard and not a double more of a 3 4 bed
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shelf in the bathroon would have been good but nice fluffy towels made up for inconvenience
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, small breakfast room due to automatic ventilation starting at around 6am we have had a lot of aroma smell from the kitchen in our room
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, A small uncomfortable bed very short Ill fitting door poorly blacked out small window above the door meant some light came into the room at night No chair in room The bathroom sink so small virtually unusable
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Few small issues with room cracks and paint missing on walls especially around window Room was very warm but a fan was present for us There is air conditioning but I was told it s turned off in winter even though it is Spring now the guests don t get the choice to us it
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast The buffet just have fruit cereals and coffee You have to ask for the breakfast and it s only available English breakfast
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Three flights of stairs with a suitcase was tough needed a lift Also no air con as it was March but rooms were roasting Rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny Breakfast room small and got very busy so often have to wait a bit for a table and not much room to wait Check out at 10 30am too early 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, basement room a bit small and warm air con faulty breakfast room cramped but did the job not the best full english ive had sausage was full of bone gristle good location for theatre tube and food and good price probably wouldnt use it again though 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny tiny tiny room small single Very uncomfortable bed Almost non existent Wi Fi connection No TV signal Nowhere to hang clothes Not enough room to store luggage and move around room No bedside table lamp No air con and window sealed off Surly breakfast staff This particular room was not really fit for purpose and not worth the money despite the location 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Ridiculously small single room containing shabby furniture dirty glassware and a tiny rock hard bed Clearly no thought at all given to comfort of guests 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny rooms Single glazed Windows let in cold and street noise Woeful breakfast Coffee was cold 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was clanking from the radiator which didn t stop even when I turned it off Had to wear ear plugs Tiny room even by London standards 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I really can t believe this hotel is classified as 4 stars a part from the price Rooms are so small that you can t open your luggage no wardrobe and you don t have enough air for breathing New windows have been placed over the old ones and in order to open them you have to jump on the bed when I tried to open it to have more air it suddenly fell down and I could have seriously hurt my hands and fingers It was really dangerous 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single rooms can be on the small side although this varies and is I suppose down to luck 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was never enough space in the morning in the breakfast room on 2 of the 3 days I was there so I was not really able to enjoy breakfast properly Also there is no lifts so its difficult if you re on the 3rd floor to take your suitcase up the steep stairs
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room in had on the road side of the building and the additional window installed to reduce traffic sound was broken and wouldn t close This meant I only had about 5 hours of sleep if that The room is also very small so at nearly 6ft tall I had to sleep at an angle to prevent my feet pressing on the wall Could have gotten much nicer had I paid just 10 more for a different hotel
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed too short I m 5ft 11 and room was very very draughty the room wasn t really a room but an outhouse to the back door 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast served at the table you needed to wait which is not very convenient during business trip The room was too small and not very comfortable Dirty curtains 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Towels too small and nowhere to hang them Very Hot in ground floor room and difficult to adjust temperature 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, When I requested an iron as they said I could do they proceeded to tell me there were no irons or boards after saying they didn t know what one was I was due for an important examination the next day and needed an iron It left me looking scruffy There was no change in the breakfast for people who had to leave before it officially started Lights came through the window all night Very small room
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Six flights of stairs to room Very loud street traffic if staying in front facing room Redecoration in room and hallways urgently required No security for left luggage you must leave it in reception without any supervision
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was chaotic and there was not enough room to sit down Staff were rushed off their feet trying to cope 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was a bit hard for our liking and windows frames in need of repair in our room and we had to wait for a table for breakfast as room is quite small when everyone arrives for breakfast at the same time but no hardship having to wait for 5 mins 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, More drawer storage in room a good job we were only in for one night Breakfast period too short 7 30 to 9 00 which meant that the staff were run off their feet dining room very cramped They did an amazing job under the circumstances 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I was on the first floor at the front of the building in room 108 It was comfortable but super small no hanging space and very noisy as it was directly above the street I would ask for a room at the back or higher up next time 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was obvious that there were 3 of us staying and only 2 sets of towels on first night and only 1 set on 2nd night Also no sheet on fold down bed and despite asking we got given a duvet Staff didn t really understand what we were saying Also only 1 toilet roll put in toilet at any one time Had to keep asking for additional toilet rolls 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny room narrow stairs I know what did I expect but 6 stories between my room and breakfast and that s a lot to navigate with no elevator 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small rooms but again cheap prices make up for it The breakfast room is a bit bleak but you get a decent full English breakfast which will last you a full day 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable and my room didn t have any air conditioning I didn t want to open the window because of the noise from the street 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, room was next to kitchen and stank of fried food and they have no proper towels just like very small face towels for you to shower with You can hear all the noise from the room above and form the reception as I had the 1st floor room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There was plenty of storage but a drawer or two would have made it 100 instead of 99 9 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was to small entering wind through all the windows The bed to small and I only am 1 73cm
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Compact single room but was OK for one night visit had everything needed
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was situated so there was a constant through the night noise like a lorry reversing This went on all night I had two hours sleep and ruined the next day as we were all so tired Second thing and this is the thing that would make me never stay again when my husband checked in he was told breakfast was till 10am We arrived at 9 02am a really rude waitress told us we were 2 min late so could not have the cooked breakfast we were really looking forward too She was not even apologetic in her manner just point blank rude When she left the room the other guests also commented on her rudeness to us So unfortunately for us we had a room where a noise kept us up till around 6am we finally had two hours sleep then we re refused breakfat Would never go back and a colleague of mine is cancelling her booking there in August 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This time my stay was awful I get room G2 on ground floor Before reconstruction of hotel on this place was restroom and shower So room was very very small After check in in room was so cold as on the street There was additional heating source but it was connected on electricity don t work when remove hotel card In the room are 2 big windows as before there was toilet and in the room was so windy that I can t sleep in the bed I moved the bed to other side of the room But than I blocked all door to toilet to go out It was very uncomfortable every evening and morning to move bed and in general cold and windy Once more ventilation system in this room looks like are common with the kitchen When in the morning they started with breakfast in the room was a smell of burning singeing Very strong smell I was in this hotel many times but this time my room I can t call as a room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I used to pay the hotel room charge when I check out However it was paid as soon as after booked hotel In this case I cannot use this booking com application 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No option of late check out or room service to have breakfast in room floorboards above our room very squeaky and noisy
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I definitely would not recommend staying here We arrived in the morning to leave our suitcases and couldn t check in yet which was fine However there was no secure space available to leave our luggage it was just left next to the reception desk all day When we came back later to check in we were given room G03 on the ground floor It was the worst room I have ever seen The room was right next to the hotel entrance so noise was definitely a problem The room was tiny you could only access the bed from one side and the tv was to the right of the bed so it would have been impossible to watch The window opened on to the side walk of Gower Street which has a lot of traffic at all times of day so noise was definitely a problem from that side as well There was a horrible smell in the room it smelled like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned in months We went to the reception to ask for a different room because the one we were given was not inhabitable but all they could offer us was some febreeze to mask the smell We ended up having to find another hotel at 8pm in the evening the night before a big work meeting 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff in dining room need to learn to have manners and smile Breakfast certainly wasn t delicious a 4cup cafeti re for a 30seater dining room is ridiculous Yes rooms small but adequate as not in room much anyway 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast finished at 9 too early in my opinion hotel does not supply towels We were not told this before arriving says on website has showers and toiletries Rooms small bed small boyfriend only 5 9 and his feet over hung the bed Very noisey from 7 30am onwards herds of elephants going up and down the stairs safe in room broken sign basically saying if anything gets stolen it s not the fault of the hotel Air con and heating in room was also broken good location but terrible hotel although staff were friendly
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very small and definitely not big enough for third person When we arrived third bed not made up and only one member of staff on duty She did not know where to get bed linen to make up bed We asked if there was a bigger room and we looked at one in the basement and one on the second floor We opted for the room on second floor I had originally requested a ground floor The second floor was inconvenient due to carrying luggage Very small shower room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Probably the smallest hotel room I have stayed in around the world with the bed taking up nearly the whole area There was mud on the valance around the bed The A C failed and the room was so stuffy and hot that I had to open the window on to noisy Gower St all night I was given a fan by reception which helped a bit 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The service at breakfast was diabolical I was not greeted at all despite several waitresses wondering rudely past me There was no glass on my table so had to wait until more were brought into the room I stood waiting as there was no coffee either and half of the cutlery was missing I stared at a waitress who finally asked if I wanted anything My breakfast came fairly quickly but toast was delayed Then there was no butter left and when the waitress spent several minutes wondering in and out and my toast getting cold came with a pot of margerine and told me the butter was frozen Not good service at all and let the hotel down completely 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We booked a double bed room which was very small and compact the room temperature was boiling hot without having heating on and nothing to cool it down but there was a portable fan and we couldn t use it Went for breakfast just before the closing time and there were so many people in the room having breakfast but there were no staff and I noticed couple of staff in the kitchen who were busy checking time on their wrist watch They both saw me standing but didn t bothered yo come out So i went back to my room and tried to make cuppa tea but there was no tea spoon anywhere O dear We just checked out and went to the cafe nearby and had breakfast 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The single sofa bed
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Wasn t the cleanest hotel but was perfectly adequate Receptionist when we checked in was lovely but rest of staff were not quite so welcoming Again not a problem if you just want to come and go Only real issue was the luggage storage not very secure and worried that somebody may take a liking to our cases more Was fine though All in all a good stay and would definitely stay again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Just felt rooms were a little to warm at night for ladies of a certain age 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Early breakfast times could be extended Very cold room as rotten window and wind blew straight in and stayed when temperatures were at freezing
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, as the weather was cold a blanket would have been a nice addition 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The sofa bed was a bit hard and the corridors and the staircase narrow 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I have never been in such a small room I couldn t even open my suitcase But then I have been told that many London rooms are very small 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift but not a big problem for us 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was too small and the room absolutely too noisy 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was smaller than expected but alright for one night Was Noisy from the traffic in Gower Street all night as the Double Glazing Window was broken 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Small room and tiny bathroom but standard for European hotels 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, quality of room not baby friendly despite a phone call prior to booking to say it was carpet rod grippers visible and could be stood on travel cot not real cot again despite a call prior to booking to confirm it wasn t a travel cot reception staff not friendly at all 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 1 Only reserve the room designated as small if it is for a child or if you are really desperate There is really very little space and almost none to put clothes let alone to store luggage 2 Very little lounge space area in the building for someone to use in order to avoid staying in the room in my case working inside the room is completely impractical unless you decide to use the bed 3 The basement restaurant area is uncomfortably small and it felt totally cramped at least whenever I tried to use it 4 There was a waiting line for breakfast which was mediocre 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff seemed a little unsure of what was what and also no room to leave luggage just stored freely in reception
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was on the small side Was in a room facing the street so there was a bit of traffic noise 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast staff were rude the room floor was uneven the bed was tilted on one side making it difficult to sleep in without falling out the window had a huge gap in the frame letting quite a draft in 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The staff were horrible On arrival I got no information other than here s your key go up these stairs I then proceeded to carry a 30kg bag up two flights of steps with no help while the staff chatted away below me On check out I asked what s the address for a cab and received the answer oh I don t know Google it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, When I arrived the allocated room had not been prepared the staff apologised and allocated me a new room which was ready 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed and pillows were very hard They had nowhere to store luggage apart from next to the reception desk and no way of monitoring who collected the bags The breakfast finished very early 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms were too small especially it is impossible to live in single small room I think its better to book the normal single rooms they were better 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room and bathroom were functional but small in loft type conversion Breakfast room was very basic No lift 3 floors Could get noisy walls thin Price a bit high Shabby lace curtain 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, there s no lift so if you struggle with stairs I would avoid 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Not the best selection for breakfast but it was included in the price you get what you pay for 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, These are minor issues which would make a considerable difference overall The ground floor room I stayed in would benefit from additional glazing to mute traffic noise An insecure tap fitting in the basin made me concerned not to break it It was a shame one of the waitresses in the breakfast room didn t understand the word sandwich 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very very small not much bigger than a cupboard TV s Arial was not plugged in and there was no instruction of how to do so Unable locate the socket No room for chair nor writing table Forced to use the room for only sleeping The window blind was broken and could not be lifted I had to discover how the lighting was activated 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There s no lift but the highest floor is 3 so it s not a big deal if you re moderately healthy
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There is a reason for the price The room was extremely small Got a room on the Gower Street side I would not have that again 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room it s self comfortable enough but vicinity of road made it very noisy if on front ground floor 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift in the hotel you or the staff have to carry your luggage up a maximum of 4 flights of somewhat narrow stairs I ve seen narrower stairs if your room is on the top floor 3rd floor The desk staff offered someone to help My wife and I are both healthy walkers and climb stairs with ease but people with bad knees may be challenged 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small that a person my size could not even fit I am a fairly small person and me and my luggage together was too much for this 5sqm small little space including bathroom that shower tho new was tiny and toilet seat was so close to sink that event I could hit my head The bed squezed toward to window was getting so much street noise I though I was gonna get nauseous from street pollution I can not warn you enough Internet photos do not always show reality There are better places for this price I urge Booking dot com to find better places or double check photo reality ratio 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Nothing
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I had a terrible experience and have since tried several times to contact the manager who has failed on each time to get back in touch with me On my first night i was woken up at 1 45 in the morning by a loud alarm going off outside my room I had to phone reception to inform them to turn it off It came on again later on in the night and completely disrupted my sleep I woke up late and tired and was so upset by the previous nights events I didn t want to eat breakfast so went out to a cafe instead on route to my meeting The following morning i was due to travel back to Devon and was very upset to find no hot water whatsoever in the shower None one in the hotel explained or apologised to me and I later overheard the receptionist say that someone was going to come and fix it later that day I would like a part refund but this hotel isn t responding Please help 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Triple room in the underground floor very dark looking like a dungeon the pictures on booking com shows very different above the ground room Due to walls ceiling curvature it was not possible to place mirror on normal height so shaving required bending me back During the day of our stay there was no hot water boiler malfunction and the staff started action to fix it only after my call There was no heating December either and the personnel was very well aware of the issue they were using electric heater at the reception desk but they started acting on the issue only when I directly asked them to do so There were no additional blankets in the whole hotel I don t even mention lack of blankets in the room as there was no cabinet in the room to store them or your belongings There is air conditioning mentioned on booking com in my room I was only able to find old fan it was cold so no big issue For me it looks like the universal recipe for a hotel in London take some old place invest in it once then run it for 20 years without any repairs and call for serious amount of money The word Palace in hotel s name is just a sad joke 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was minuscule Only just enough space to cram a single bed in Don t use if you have any incling of claustophobia Breakfast was canteen style Far from palacial 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very expensive and not that value for money Rooms are bad Rooms services are not available Cleaning people are a bit rude Rooms are very small and very congested 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room I stayed in was really small The toiletries were uninspiring 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Extremely small room too small for a wardrobe you can t walk in the room The door hardly opens Window was broken noise cold air light was flickering Wifi extremely slow and unstable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Noise and smell from the kitchen
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, On top floor so lots of stairs hotel was very warm slept with window wide open thus making it noisey 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms facing onto Gower Street can be noisy earplugs may be of use to light sleepers 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very noisy as the rooms are just next to a main road Asked if I can have a quiet room but was told everything they have faces the road
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Tiny tiny room But did all I needed as was only there to sleep However the road was very noisy
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast room was too small and crowded
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Didn t sleep well at all as sound insulation to road was poor The old window wouldn t close properly so I was subject to very loud traffic noise for most of the night A corridor fire door wasn t working properly so it banged loudly into the early ours 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The bed was so small I had my feet sticking out all night plus I wasn t a proper double bed so struggled to sleep If in paying over 100 quid I expect a decent sleep 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The double bed was too small This was smaller than an average double not the double stated in the description We had an awful nights sleep and there was a 2 inch gap under the door allowing in light all night and noise Decor was in need of updating and cleaning in the main corridors 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, the hotel is on a loud street so it was hard to sleep The rooms were really small and dark I was disappointed 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Unfortunately I was in a room between the breakfast room and the kitchen so was woken around 6 30 by staff preparing breakfast Not a problem if you have to be up Not great if you re a tourist who doesn t 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The breakfast was average poor choice and staff were not very friendly We were not late for breakfast by any means but orange juice and milk were not refilled and everything seemed too much trouble 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, no table in the room problems with the door of the wardrobe tiny tiny room but fine if you re there just for sleeping
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, From what I could tell my room was actually a converted entrance hall with a single bed in it I m used to having small rooms in London but this really was ridiculous The bed was so small that my feet were hanging out of the bottom I m 5 9 and it was situated alongside a drafty window so I had a draft on my face all night At the top of the bed was where I assume the back door used to be so more drafts came through here 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Cleanliness of the room could ve been better Standards not reflected in price Definitely felt only paying for location Layout of room was a little awkward due to compact size but didn t stay in the room long so not massive negative 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in With outstretched arms I could touch both walls The hair attached to my fried egg for breakfast
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Worst experience I ve had ever while traveling Could nt sleep due to the fact the I couldn t stretch my legs because the bed was small and between two walls Do not book here 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small that I felt uncomfortable There was no space for the luggage The breakfast room was also very small You had to wait some minutes for an empty seat 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Expensive Wish I had looked at more options for the price I paid 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Felt uneasy with front door not being locked at night on ground floor Door lock was dodgey on room too breakfast not great all under done except bacon 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Shabby run down dirty stains on the bedding mould up the curtains Rude unhelpful staff Make sure you read the T C s of your booking to allow for refundable cancellations as this is not a nice place to stay 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Sofa bed was so uncomfortable very lumpy and bedding was a bit thin No ventilation in the bathroom Quality of breakfast could be greatly improved
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, 3rd floor room no lift was a bit of a trial Low door to room hit my head a couple of times Slight slope to floor and hence bed made sleeping a little uncomfortable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff couldn t have been more disinterested in their guest stay The room was very dusty actually fluffy in some instances such as on top of wardrobes and light fittings and I suggest they occasionally check the traps in the showers what I found was disgusting 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast too early start and finish time no facilities such as bar was a basic but first impression of outside was poor 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very small room A bit of noise on the street side 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was very small no place to put luggage No elevator and no one to help carry bags up and down the stairs Breakfast ends at 9 am 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room much to small to be acceptable No plages to place clothes or luggage It was basicly a locker being used as a room You shouldn t rent out rooms like this

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was way too small no elevator no wardrobe and last day the room hasn t been cleaned at all Definetly not worth the money 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel,No Negative
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It needs a little tlc and a paint job in public areas The kitchen staff are surly and very unhelpful and that s not just from me alone 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This was the smallest room I ever slept The room was nothing except a bed surrounded by walls from three sides and a small hallway from door to bed Internet connection was not stable
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Rooms very small extremely noisy from the road and doors banging into the early hours of the morning No bar or lounge and dining room not big enough to accommodate all guests at breakfast breakfast also very very early only available until 9am 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was a bit tight in the room with the pull out chair bed for the third person but we expected that and felt it was good value for money 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, It was very uncomfortable the bed was not nice and it was really noisy I could barely sleep there I opened the window to get some air but then all the noise came from outside Then there was a door banding every 30 minutes which woke me up all the time Wouldn t go there for business again I needed some good rest and I didn t get it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room was incredibly small also the window wouldn t stay open which is why a fan was placed in the room but because the room was so small there was no room to move 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff uniformed on local restrictions or facilities such as car parking Items broken in bathroom such as toilet roll holder and left in disrepair 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was 2 50 m x 1 90 m with a shower built in Room price is out of proportion regarding poor quality of the hotel I will absolutely advise people not to book this hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single rooms are TOO small and all facing the main Street noisy They are not 11mq as stated on the description but something like 5 6 mq just the bed and a small bathroom no wardrobe and no space to open your luggage It could still be fine if the price were half what they request 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, not very clean bed uncomfortable very noisy but that can t really be helped with noise from outside 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, single room far to small and hot the window would not stay open and overpriced as you were no taking up bed space only room for one single bed in room 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Didn t really enjoy the breakfast and the room could have done with a lick of paint 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This is no place for a solo traveler The single rooms do not even have enough room for a chair They are right on the very busy road with high traffic volume and terrible noise including ambulances from a nearby hospitals My room was hot even in September No ventilation 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was very small with barely enough floor space to fit the luggage 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Very poky narrow room though I did have choice of first floor or third floor maybe the third floor room would have been bigger Perhaps a little overpriced because of rugby world cup 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NEXT TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SO THE STAFF STARTED MAKING NOISES OUTSIDE MY DOOR AT 6 6 30am 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Inadequate lighting there was only one light on a rather high ceiling at the far end of the room It was impossible to read or do anything else except watch TV once the sun set 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, if i hv to tell an inconvenient is the 4 ramps of stairs to reach my room 209 on 2nd floor im a smoker n everytime I had to go up n down to smoke outside of the hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, No lift had to carry cases 6 flights of stairs net curtains dirty covering rotten wood Windows hall way stairs wood work dirty needs painting
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, tiny dining room meant everyone was squashed together Not enough tables so had to sit at a brakfast bar that came up to my chest very uncomfortable mediocre breakfast Altogether not worth 155 per night
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was tiny and there wasn t a traveler compatible outlet in the bathroom but that s my only complaint Not a deal breaker by any means 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was ridiculously small Basically the size of the small bed and the doorway Smallest I have ever experienced Not even room to put your travel bag down Literally a cupboard 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, We were on the top floor and there is no elevator which made lugging our suitcases up the staircases a bit of a challenge 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Located on a one way street which was a bit quiet when walking home late at night Not many people around 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, This is the right hotel for you if you are prepared to 1 have neither a chair nor a table in your room 2 have no hanger for your towels 3 use a breakfast room with an open kitchen that makes you smell like sausage and bacon for hours 4 have a metal grilled window if you stay in a Lower Ground room with NO ESCAPE should there be a fire in the hallway of stairway 5 NOT be able to open a window 6 NOT have ventilation in the windowless bathroom 7 NOT have anyone guard your baggage after check out they just tell you to leave it next to the reception desk without any need to identify yourself when you come to pick it up later 8 carry your baggage to the third floor no elevator There was no TV remote control in my room and the safe didn t work Fire doors were always left open even though a sign told you to keep them shut My advice Look for another hotel 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, There is no place to park a car for pick up or drop off which was quite awkward The Breakfast Room is very room and there were times we had to wait to get a table 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Some of our group s rooms were on the small side One person had a single room that was no bigger than a large broom cupboard 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Single room excellent training for my trip to the International Space Station Cramped no storage access to electric sockets required kneeling etc Good job the cat was not with me because I would not have been able to swing it Bed although comfortable felt it was on a slight angle to the right from the horizontal Had to climb on the bed to suit window and draw blind Road noise just about bareable 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Receptionist wasn t helpful when I asked him to look into the dodgy lock He said no need to worry I don t really need the lock as it was safe area 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Staff on arrival completely unhelpful My room and bed were extremely small and poorly located on the ground floor with smells from the kitchen and noise from inside and out I enquired about upgrading I was willing to pay the extra but despite having other rooms available I checked online they would not allow me to change rooms Very poor customer service and a strange attitude if they d allowed me to upgrade they would have received more income and would have had a satisfied customer 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The room was so small it was ridiculous How they can sell that as a room and not as a broom cupboard is beyond me 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, First room we viewed was lower ground level right by air conditioning unit for the building very noisy Second room we viewed and then stayed in was narrow but comfortable However cleanliness was very questionable it was a long time since the surfaces had been dusted The two towels we were provided with were hand towels not sufficient for a grown person to use after showering Staff were accommodating with our requests needs but certainly could have been more pleasant about it 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The only negative would be to keep on top of the decoration as it did look a little tired and lacking in character given the age of the property 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Breakfast was early for leisure guests The climb to the third floor is difficult especially with large luggage 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Generally a littler tired In need of a little sprucing windows cleaned and painted and back yard brightrned

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, My room was tiny my feet and legs halfway up to my knees were dangling off the end of my bed while I slept literally not enough room to swing a cat 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, I knew the room was going to be small but it made it hard that there was no room to put my suitcase which made it hard to function in an already cramped situation 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Room too small for 3 people Three friends and it was double bed and chair bed Did not want to share bed No lounge for night time when you came back just to have relaxing nightcap after busy day Also room getting a bit tired Needing a few repairs

Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Would ve liked the option of early check in as we arrived early and had to leave bags and return later 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, breakfast was in the basement and was very cramped Not enough room for all the guests and the staff didn t even acknowledge us while we stood waiting for a table Felt very rushed when we did eventually sit down Decided to eat breakfast out the second morning 
Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, The rooms were not at all what was shown in the pictures they were extremely small I booked six months in advance and I was placed in the basement There was no air conditioning and since I was in the basement ground window we couldn t open the windows for air There was a humidifier in the room that didn t work properly and was not vented out of the room properly When asked to switch rooms I was told that the room I was in was their only double bed room Find that very hard to believe On my last day a staff member male opened the door on me while I was changing without knocking When I looked up reviews on google I saw a woman post that the same thing happened to her Staff was rude Breakfast room was small and overcrowded I would never stay here again Not to mention the bed was broken and extremely uncomfortable

Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom had a little sewage smell Getting into the bath tub was not easy nor safe The pillows were a little too firm for us 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was hot with no working air conditioning though a fan was provided The window opened on to a small recess in the middle of the block 1 metre squared filled with large pipework i e a functioning window Poor continental breakfast selection Selection of tea in the hotel limited to English tea or Green tea 
Gainsborough Hotel, The beds were a bit small I am only 6ft and hung over the end But then it added to the feeling of being back in 1oth century London No mini fridges in the room so don t expect to be able to keep anything cold that you bring back with you 
Gainsborough Hotel, Everything looked a little tired Bathroom fitments were decidedly old The whole room needed referbishing although I liked the style 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small and old Definitely needs lots of improvement 
Gainsborough Hotel, Tiny single room to be expected but this room was so hot There was a portable air conditioning unit in the room that was so noisy you could hear it when you came out of the lift 5 rooms away Impossible to sleep with the noise of that and the heat when it was turned off The shower also had a lot of black mold in around the tiles and all of the sealer Tiles were cracked and black in between them The bathroom and furniture in the single room leave a lot to be desired and are in desperate need of replacing No way a four star More like two One member of check in staff was also very rude to me They were unable to take card payments when I arrived as there was something wrong with their system She kept telling me to go to a cash point to get cash out to pay for my two nights stay and wanted another 50 cash as a deposit I told her I would do so in a while but wanted to go to my room first as I had a long journey getting to the hotel and wanted to drop my luggage off When I came down about half an hour later she shouted at me across the reception in front of other guests and asked me if I had fixed the problem with my card Not only was this incredibly rude and tactless of her it was also very inappropriate as my card was perfectly fine it was their system that was down She made me feel like some kind of low life When I came back with all of the cash for her she started speaking in a foreign language with the porter I couldnt say of she was talking about me as I didnt know the language The other receptionist then kindly asked them to refrain from doing this as they had a guest present and it was very rude of them to do so Instead of making me feel like a low life they could of easily just taken payment by my card when their system was up again Needless to say I wont be staying there again despite the great location 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small The window in the bedroom did not open The air conditioning was unbearably loud and not incredibly effective so it was oppressively hot preventing any sleep on my first night Fortunately the weather was cooler on my second night so I didn t require the air conditioning 
Gainsborough Hotel, When we booked through booking com I booked an air conditioned room which I did not get The stopper in the sink was not working So the water did not drain properly even though I complained nothing was done at all i asked for an iron and ironing board to be kept jn my room while going out but was told that the hotel was full so cannot keep in room and that they would put it in after a couple of hours but not done had to ask for it again the next day n then it was delivered Will not return to this hotel would rather pay a bit more and at least get what you booked for 
Gainsborough Hotel, Maintenance of the rooms Everything seemed to be either worn out or tired The chairs in the breakfast room were too low to be comfortable especially in the window seats The hot water was dangerously hot I had to change rooms after the first night because the bed was so uncomfortable and the noise of the air con was unbearable Noise from the street woke me up at 4 40am The en suite facilities were minute 
Gainsborough Hotel, Very small room for the first night they were catering for a regular customer so the gave me very small room were the shower is bad never known when to get hot or cold water On the second night i was given a big esh room and the shower was ok 4star and no drinking water provided On the last night someone was smoking in his room and the staff couldn t find out who and could not stop it i had to put a towel under the door to stop the smell My wife has asthma and suffered from that I feel the hotel is good value for money I feel it is not up to 4 star
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a disgrace Have never been anywhere as bad Breakfast a joke No bread left Staff clean the tables by whiping the crumbs on the chairs and floor No wonder they have mice The staff keep picking up the folk used to pick up chesse and ham and lay them down ON THE CHEESE AND HAM Everyones hands touch everyones ham and cheese Beyond stupid I am beyond words frankily
Gainsborough Hotel, Everything except location 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is quaint but the rooms need an uplift 
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff not helpful Air conditioner did not work and had been replaced by a mobile one so noisy we turned it off Truely awful shower with no pressure and long overdue with the bath for complete refurbishment No drinking water sign in the bathroom what Bathroom bulbs broken with wire exposure and others that did not work Very small for 3 adults Dirty carpet Walls needed cleaning Minute lift for 4 people No interest in checkout at concerns about the room Will never go back to this place
Gainsborough Hotel, Welcome person weird Very long time to check in No invoices available Room very average especially the bathroom Not a good value for money
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was out dated chipped paint dirty stained carpet and tapestries and two very small uncomfortable beds We even booked a room to have one bed as we traveled as a couple and were given a tiny hole of a room It would be the equivalent of staying at a Motel 6 in America from the 1980s in the middle of all the museum zone of Washington DC Would not recommend as the price for two nights was close to 365 in US currency Spend the extra 200 or more and stay at one of the nicer hotels in the area 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel appears nice however the rooms are terrible Very small very old and tired The hands free shower could not reach the wall mount as the hose was too short so you had to hold the shower head with one hand The air conditioner did not work so the room was very hot and stuffy Breakfast usually ran out of food and the chairs were lower than the table because the cushions were flattened due to age and use 
Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms are shabby I was told the room we were given was one of the best Wifi non existent shabby furniture small double bed Bathroom was big enough but limescale all over taps chipped sink and bath Shower was the worst I ve experienced in 20 years visiting London No milk shower gel soap etc on 2nd day Water from shower was either scalding or freezing Other large cities manage a standard why not London On checkout no one asked how our stay was 
Gainsborough Hotel, My partner and I booked for a romantic eve on entering the room was made up and looked presentable When we unfolded the bed sheets we found dried blood on the sheets We were horrified a bed was made up with sheets like this The manager only offered 25 refund or a free breakfast for one Very poor experience 
Gainsborough Hotel, Twin room very small Only one power board with two outlets already used for TV and light so hassle for two people to charge everything Internet was slow and intermittent Hairdryer next to useless but they had a real one at front desk Poor communication between morning and evening staff meant things that were promised didn t happen 
Gainsborough Hotel, The first room had an incredibly noisy air conditioner unit with a large tube venting through a hole in the window Because of the tube the window couldn t be opened for fresh air Also the mattress felt like there were bars across it When I said that the room wasn t suitable I was told I couldn t move After some heated discussion with the person at the front desk whose English was not adequate I was moved into another room the second day While that room had a decent mattress and air conditioning and the window opened the sink in the bathroom had no water I reported the sink twice and was ignored I had to collect water from the shower in a plastic bottle to brush my teeth I was there on business if I d had time to research other options I would have changed hotels I won t stay there again 
Gainsborough Hotel, large portable and noisy air con unit in the room lift extremely small old and clunky
Gainsborough Hotel, Cleanliness was poor bathroom floor was cracked old fashion air con vent in window and standing machine which took up a considerable amount of floor space Room images were generous and did not reflect the reality
Gainsborough Hotel, In need of refurbishment inside room 302 shower water pressure is not good more electric sockets needed clean windows too change light bulbs for bright ones
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were too under pressure to be helpful Breakfast very poor staff were carrying food from hotel across the street Basement room no windows opened Hairdryer not in sight of a mirror aircon dripped down the wallpaper
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were not the most accommodating I had one staff bang on my door literally two mins of a long a stressful journey over there looking for a pen that the receptionist of 2 days had missed laid 
Gainsborough Hotel, Tired decor Wallpaper missing toilet leaking tiny room large a c unit and a huge gap at the bottom of the room door all gave a poor impression I was expecting a 4 star hotel and a 4 poster bed in our deluxe double room instead we had 2 singlebeds pushed together which took up most of the room space The receptionstaff were good and very helpful The breakfast staff were indifferent bordering on rude Breakfast was OK but not the best All in all although it served its purpose the hotel was not what I was expecting and certainly does not deserve to call itself a 4 star hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so tiny that you could not fully open your suitcase except for on the bed Getting in and out of the bathroom was a shuffle and dance and the sink so minuscule that you could hardly do anything with it The size of the room or rather lack thereof was only topped by the heat in there Despite a mere 23 C outside it was stuffy and hot all day and all night although I had opened the window as much as possible Horrible 
Gainsborough Hotel, Bed close to bathroom it is impossible to open door without scraping your feet Left bathroom door open all night as I need the loo often and didn t fancy wrestling the door every time I got up
Gainsborough Hotel, Could not drink the tap water The shower was extremely small The mattress was lumpy 
Gainsborough Hotel, Dated uncomfortable bed no hair dryer check in chaotic bar restaurant across the road at sister hotel Understaffed at breakfast for others wanting cooked you d waitress clearly needed support 
Gainsborough Hotel, The lift was tiny and it took several trips to take our luggage to our room However the person at the desk cheerfully did this for us
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very hot and we couldn t open the window 
Gainsborough Hotel, Although this is advertised as a 4 star hotel we had a 2 star level room at best Rug and walls were filthy Bed terribly uncomfortable old and unfortunately saw how stained mattress cover was Noisy doors slamming heard throughout night Thank goodness we were only here one night would not have been able to stay another night Water in bathroom states it is not for drinking but that s what they expect you to make your coffee with in the morning 
Gainsborough Hotel, N A
Gainsborough Hotel, Single room is very cramped with a noisy air con unit The extractor fan in the shower room didn t appear to be working and it smelt a bit damp 
Gainsborough Hotel, I had asked for a room with a shower with a hose The first room they showed me did not have this facility and the room was very narrow and faced on to the main road with passing traffic noise It could have done with a lot of changes When I complained they put in me a basement room with a double bed suitable wardrobe and other facilities The shower over the bath was on a hose but the basin plug was non existent They tried to make a replacement but that did not work The bathroom could have done with being refurbished There was no traffic noise as the small window faced the back of the Lycee Francais which was behind the hotel and all one heard was when the pupils were playing football before and after school The lady at reception said as I was in a double room I would have to pay extra I refused The only extra I paid was for Continental and 1 Full English breakfasts which I had had and were excellent with very helpful staff 
Gainsborough Hotel, There was nothing I particularly didn t like If i were to be really really picky the room might have been a bit small if I was travelling with my partner but then I am a larger lady so it might not bother others Other than that although the room had two hairdryers I was glad I had brought my own as they weren t really suitable for drying long hair Again not a problem for the majority of the population and not unusual in hotels 
Gainsborough Hotel, My single room was very small but adequate for a one night stay at least it had a good en suite Floor standing air conditioning unit was VERY noisy and could not open window as tube from unit went out through window so window was fixed shut However it was very effective in cooling the room quickly on a very hot London day but you would not want it on all night Did not sleep very well due to poor quality of pillows One was thin and hard the other very lumpy I did bring this to the attention of the receptionist when I checked out and she said she would change the lumpy one Very unusual to see a sign in bathroom saying not to drink tap water and had to pay 2 for a bottle of water If tap water not drinkable I think hotel should provide a bottle of water in room Wallpaper rather faded and could do with updating 
Gainsborough Hotel, We were shown 4 rooms They were all tired and shabby and well overpriced The bed was uncomfortable The tiles in the shower were cracked The handle had fallen off the draw and the shower almost scalded us each time we used it The room was not comfortable This was fefinstely not 4 star The bar didn t even have any wine when we wanted a drink in the evening 
Gainsborough Hotel, Our room certainly did not resemble any of the ones pictured It was dark gloomy and was at basement level I booked a family room for myself husband and daughter based upon the photographs on the website I would not choose a dark windowless room for my daughter to sleep in and was relieved we were in and out of there prior to the warmer days as I believe it would have been very unpleasant in the airless rooms The shower nozzle was constantly falling off and hitting us on the head The water temperature constantly changed from hot to cold 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, The smart elegant feel of the hotel and warm welcome was let down by the deluxe single room with en suite facilities that I was given It was smaller than expected and rather cramped not ideal for a 3 night stay The decor needed an upgrade and the mattress replacing Unfortunately it was not the 4 star experience I was expecting for my excitedly awaited London break 
Gainsborough Hotel, Dark room Dark curtains even the lamps were not spreading much light The showers watersupply seemed as old as the hotel No drinking water for the room 
Gainsborough Hotel, although continental breakfast was included in price 5 extra per person was required for a cooked breakfast 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room we were allocated was in the basement and definitely not the room in the picture when we booked It had only one window which was up fairly high and the school behind played football every night until about 7 30 pm and quite often the ball would hit the window At the very least there should be a security grill or something over the window so that the balls from the school do not hit the window The bathroom left more than a little to be desired as the water from the shower would leak through the gap in the glass partition and end up on the floor where we had to use hand towels to mop it up Also the T V reception was quite poor and we only could get a couple of channels We also asked for room service one night and were told that we would have to go across the road to your sister hotel and get our own room service If we had realized we were going to be in a 2 star accommodation hotel we would have booked elsewhere 
Gainsborough Hotel, The air con struggled
Gainsborough Hotel, I reported there were ants in our bed when we woke up in the morning there was also mold between the tiles in the bathroom and the toilet roll holder was not the correct insert for the unit on the wall so as soon as you touch the toilet roll it pings off I was also disappointed that we had to pay an additional 5 for an English breakfast and they went to a property across the road for it Not at all professional I feel that we should have some kind of refund to be honest 
Gainsborough Hotel, Sorry question mixed up loved the location room excellent except needed a rail on the wall down steps to bathroom as disabled Otherwise everything except breakfast spot on
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom wasn t up to standard Flaking paint on the ceiling dirty marks on the shower screen loose threads on the countertop The door into our room would not shut properly you had to give it a good few strong pulls to get it to lock otherwise anyone could just walk in No drinkable tap water in the room had to pay for water No full English included in the price of hotel which was a shame for the amount we paid 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel room was very small and dingy The bathroom was old the shower barely worked as the water pressure was so bad The bed was old and very uncomfortable It was over priced for what you got The website is misleading in that is says they have a restaurant whereas they really just send you across the road to another hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were tired and dated Very dark decor tea coffee facilities We re poor Bathrooms needed rupdating lnot sparkling clean Shower doors not secure Beds uncomfortable needed duvets and feather pillows Toiletries nice Wallpaper coming off walls
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel was a little tired and in need of bringing up to date however I suspect the price would be higher if that had happened There were very few plugs available in the room for charging but an extension was available for the kettle and so we used that which made us move the phones away from our bed not such a bad idea 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel and the room were not worth the money paid Room small decoration very bad Lining on curtains totally rotted and shredded Hotel generally in poor decoration and not clean No bar or facilities as advertised No free WiFi Definitely not 4 star as advertised I would like to claim money back How can this be achieved 
Gainsborough Hotel, No bar fridge or no way to keep milk cold for my two daughters it appeared that the room had had a space for mini bar fridge but nothing 
Gainsborough Hotel, We stopped at this hotel for just one night thankfully When we wanted to give feedback about our experience the available representative was Lara We started discussing the following points with Lara and she fully agreed with us stating I know but I have to work here When we were asked to settle the bill and complain afterwards I declined and wanted to discuss the issues now Well Lara s attitude really turned aggressive rolling eyes and all her conversation was now conducted through shouting When we asked to see the manager Lena we were told she was unavailable as on holiday Lara was able to converse with her during the time we provided the feedback but we were not allowed to talk to her Discussion points in brief The hotel was a 4 star hotel But obviously needs money and a lot of work doing to bring it to even a reasonable level certainly to our room When we checked in we were left waiting whilst Lara talked to people that arrived after us When we were trying to complain about the accommodation we were left 40 minutes whilst the maintenance man verified the state of the room and appliances that did not work The room was grubby bits broken walls and furniture had chunks out of it discoloured and in the bathroom mould due to water damage tv didn t work the kettle worked intermittently shower head didn t fix to bracket so you had to hold whilst showering freezing cold water for the sink During breakfast I asked for tomato ketchup there was none When my wife asked for semi skimmed milk for her cornflakes she was brought hot milk when asked for more cold milk for her cornflakes she was informed there was none left Hearing this Lara brought the waitress out to confirm the story she told the waitress there was milk wasn t there she was twice told they had run out before she ordered her go 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom needs to be bigger with countet space and faucets that work better larger shower Also air conditioning would have been good Floors were awfully squeaky Elevator really small Good thing we were not heavy people 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room didn t really have accessible wall sockets to plug in things There was an extension lead on the floor which we had to use We had to boil the kettle on the floor due to this Noisy fan in bathroom room 111 Note It isn t the hotel s fault but the taxi company they booked was expensive 12 for less than a 3 min drive Apparently that is London 
Gainsborough Hotel, We had to wait well over an hour for our request for a twin room and I d just finished a gruelling day of chemo We were given a free breakfast as a good will gesture The duty manager on the following day could not understand why we weren t given the twin room straightaway as there were a few available The head manager did not reply to any emails regarding this very unfortunate situation 
Gainsborough Hotel, n a
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was in basement no view or daylight the bathroom was small tiny corner sink which you could not stand in front of room was data and also a tie wrap on the towel rail Additional charge for English breakfast which cost total of 12 each and was not worth it as the bacon was under cooked should have come with toast however having asked for it she waitress failed to bring it also at to ask twice for tea oh yes no tomato or brown

Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in serious need of a makeover Our first impression was of a cold dull and dreary room there wasn t even a duvet on the bed just old blankets and a cover The bathroom was small and smelt mouldy and the shower was inadequate 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel failed to enter Booking com s reservation into the system As a result they double booked on us and we were unable to stay in the hotel for the first of the two nights we had booked Worse still we had arrived at the hotel at 9 30 in the morning on the day of our arrival expecting to be able to leave our bags and spend the rest of the day sight seeing Instead we had to spend the whole morning waiting to know whether the hotel would honour the booking or simply leave me and my family on the street Eventually after several hours fobbing us off with excuse after excuse the hotel transferred us to another hotel across the street but only after a very stressful experience We were not alone the hotel had also double booked on a party of six elderly American tourists who were also forced to wait several hours to see if they would have a room for the night The one bright spot was Booking com who really stood by us when we telephoned to tell them what was going on Without Booking com s intervention and strong support for us I really don t know whether the hotel would have found another room for us 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very tired I could not get in the room to start with as the lock did not work The shower is very poor with little pressure and the shower door was falling off 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bedroom was very dark and tied but adequate and clean 
Gainsborough Hotel, Not really a 4 star hotel starting to show its age A little expensive for what you get Walls are very thin so sound travels between rooms Breakfast bacon was burnt to the point of being inedible cold toast served before the Bacon and Eggs with no butter Single sausage in a 12 breakfast is a little rich There are far better options for food a short walk away 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was rather hot for our personal comfort but able to open windows Other tables offered toast for two mornings we weren t not really a problem as got some when we asked but wondered what it was about us that it wasn t offered

Gainsborough Hotel, Possibly the worst hotel we have stayed at in London We had to refuse the first room offered as it stank of smoke We did not have airconditioning as advertised the room was small and cramped and nothing like any of the photos on booking com or the hotel website I cannot see how it could be classed as a deluxe room which is what we requested and were charged for The shower was almost impossible to control in terms of temperature and the hot water was so scalding hot as to be dangerous Our key needed replacing twice which was inconvenient as the lift was extremely slow There did not seem to be anyone of any seniority present and I am now about to email the manager as the compensation we were given in no way reflected the terrible experience we had The continental breakfast was extremely limited
Gainsborough Hotel, Difficult to find the Hotel Sign is small and impossible to see from the other side of the road Single room is very tiny furniture is old and bed very uncomfortable Tiny bathroom and difficult to get into and out the shower Room need serious refurbishment Very disappointment with the room compared to how the other rooms looked like in the pictures Very expensive rate for what you get Did not match the 4 star rating

Gainsborough Hotel, Stayed for 9 nights Cleanliness of the room could be better The room was very tiny not much to clean but could see the dust after the 5 day and by the 7th and 8th could see the dust collected over the surfaces Plus they could have considered the fact that we are staying for 9 nights and given us a better room I mean i even overheard the staff talking about how bad in terms of location our room 114 is

Gainsborough Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable with hard springs that you could feel all over the mattress Room is tired and needs redecorating making it look very scruffy Looked as though it hadn t been done up since the early 90 s No mirror at the dressing table had to remove the mirror from the bathroom wall and lean it against the wall at the back of the dressing table so I could see myself while using the hairdryer Mirror at the back was caked in dust behind it when I removed it so you can tell how long it had been since last cleaned properly or decorated 
Gainsborough Hotel, Radiator in my room wouldn t switch off and although a member of staff tried to sort this he couldn t Ended up moving to another room on my first night Soundproofing poor could hear people talking in the next room and noises from rooms above and doors closing Lots of traffic noise until about midnight Small things such as torn and grubby net curtain and problems with room key despite keeping it away from my phone

Gainsborough Hotel, I had booked a Deluxe Double Room I DID NOT RECEIVE A DELUXE DOUBLE ROOM BUT A TWIN ROOM I m very angry and upset as I physically had to move the two beds together and this did not help at all It created a gap in the middle My partner had come to visit me from a business trip and the whole night it was a nightmare When I informed the receptionist of the issue she said Booking com you guys had put that order through I showed her my phone to show the booking said double bed but she said im sorry i can t do anything about it I m very disappointed both myself and my partner had a sleepless night In the morning when I woke up I noticed a mouse run from one side of the room to the other I m not a person to moan and kick up a fuss but this truly isn t fair I informed the receptionist about the issues in the morning very nicely and she apologised but what good is that I love the way your company works and hold it at great standards I was confused as to why she would blame Booking com for the incorrect room We ve booked room s previously and have had no issues Haz Taher

Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms looked a bit tired and in need of refresh It was odd to have in February Christmas background music playing gin the dining room whilst having breakfast 
Gainsborough Hotel, This is not a four star hotel Not so clean Spilled milk in the coffee cabinet for 5 days within the day we arrived they never cleaned it Not a value for money hotel We paid for the deluxe room and they gave us a room in the 1 floor without even warning us 
Gainsborough Hotel, The floorboards were old and not fully nailed done so when next door one way returned to their room at 1 am we were woken up with 5 mins of loud creaking floorboards And we were woken up again at 2 am when next door the other way allowed their door to slam closed as the closing mechanism didn t cushion the final closure No bread or toaster available may be toast isn t considered to be a part of a continental breakfast The place is on the cusp of needing refurbishment so a 4 star hotel not really 
Gainsborough Hotel, Breakfast was basic not good value for money Very small lift Hotel is not buggy child friendly Hotel itself was dated could do with refurbishment I paid for a deluxe double room and i dont think i would have liked to see the standard double room as our room was tiny Furniture was also dated curtains and bed linen old No iron in the room leaky bath and hair dryer in the bathroom not working

Gainsborough Hotel, The room was soo small i couldnt open my suitcase There was not heating in the room and the window was broken The isolation was very poor and you could hear guests from other rooms talking like they were next to you Overall i would never stay in the hotel again The only postivie thing about the stay was the Romanian girl which works there as a room service and she was the one helpfull one

Gainsborough Hotel, The bed in my room was old and uncomfortable and the d cor very tired with torn net curtains I had an uncomfortably warm room with no means to alter the temperature The restaurant for evening dining was across the road and the menu on display uninspiring so I ate elsewhere Small things I know but it made an impact on my stay 
Gainsborough Hotel, First room was cold The windows were old style but also actually old so some cold breeze was coming through So we had our room changed It wasn t cold anymore but the shower and the sink were terrible Shower head was pretty much broken and it was difficult to have a proper shower very very weak water flow And the faucet of the sink was too short to even use it properly When washing my face I had to get some water in the sink and then wash instead of using water directly from the faucet Other amenities were good enough though

Gainsborough Hotel, See above breakfast dinner appeared to be brought from the Hotel across the road the breakfast was carried uncovered The dinner was served in the Hotel lobby as the Dining Room was not open although meals were served until 9pm When the meal was booked we were not told the Dining Room was closed The bar lobby only had two small tables some chairs very uncomfortable to sit at it felt like eating in a waiting room The experience was not helped by someone sitting at a side table with a take away The meals were not particularly good For a four star Hotel it was very disappointing At first for breakfast we were seated at a table with extremely low chairs which made it very uncomfortable to reach the table We had to ask to be moved The room had seen better days the bathroom had cracked tiles one curtain tie back was wripped holding on to it s hook by tattered material Again for the price it left something to be desired 
Gainsborough Hotel, We changed rooms after one night due to the lift noise adjoining our room Breakfast was a let down with small dry croissants flannel bread for toast and lessons needed in making tea 
Gainsborough Hotel, Spent one night in a small room at the back of the hotel on the ground floor That room was possibly ok for storage Nothing to do with 3 4 star hotel Dated not cleaned properly filthy bed cover lumpy bed standing ac unit with a plastic hose laying in the room connected to an window that did not close properly because of the hose and was facing the playing grounds of French lyc e Was moved to a nicer room on a higher floor after I complained to the hotel staff Breakfast is a joke 
Gainsborough Hotel, single room bathroom very shabby grouting shower head very discoloured no hook in bathroom to hang robe towel clothes electric sockets were a 4 plug ext would not have put clothes in wardrobe drawers had better with cont breakfast included and cheaper price cant comment on breakfast as i had not ordered any 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, This is a 4 star hotel and the wall paper was peeling and torn off in some cases There was no iron for clothing in the room The bathroom looked dodgy but it was a place to stay 
Gainsborough Hotel, room was very small in fact I can call it only half a room hadn t seen actually a single bed when you book a single room for a long time but there was no room for a double bed anyway 
Gainsborough Hotel, it s expensive given it was a very compact room and that breakfast isn t included Unable to open window for some fresh air 
Gainsborough Hotel, The beds were clean but were really old and so not that comfortable The window wouldn t close properly and kept rattling during the night The bathroom had cracked tiles and could do with a complete uplift 
Gainsborough Hotel, Wifi didn t work by designated ID and PW Receptionist and responsible person also didn t have the solution In addition I had been waking up by cleaner before checking out two hour early Furthermore TV channel was not set up 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bedroom was small but serviceable but the ensuite bathroom was grotty with loose flaky grouting and stained wall and floor tiles The soap dish was hanging off the wall 
Gainsborough Hotel, Check in a real bottle neck had to wait 10 minutes while they sorted some travel arrangements and a difficult payment 
Gainsborough Hotel, The whole Hotel is old dirty and in need of renovation The Staff were all foreign with a poor command of the english language The Hotel Owner is trying to maximise income at the expense of guests comfort 
Gainsborough Hotel, basement room nice to get a good price but you pay for it as far as what floor they put you on not a very pleasant stay
Gainsborough Hotel, Emne Hotel Rating Good morning I visited London for a few days partly private and partly business stay We ended up booking one night through Booking com after looking for 4 stars hotel in the South Kensington area This hotel was the Gainsborough Hotel 7 11 Queensberry Place a hotel rated as a 4 stars hotel by AA I am travelling a lot sometimes over 150 traveling days per year I have never I staying in a 4 star rated hotel with such old and low standard The staff was welcoming and helpful in every way but the standard of the hotel was definitely NOT anything near what one should expect when booking a 4 stars hotel the standard of this hotel is what one could expect if booking a 2 stars hotel The hotel was old and everything had a low and very worn out standard not even a 220v European type socket for shaving machine in the newest and recently renovated bath room No heating air condition except for a small electric oven placed in a corner of the room one could switch on off manually oneself No heating in bathroom too cold to wanting to take a shower The guest areas of the hotel in general were as said old fashioned and very worn out from furniture toilets wallpaper etc etc to standard of dining room kitchen etc We were told we got a renovated room which was correct but the room standard was still extremely low If I was given an older room with an even older and worn out standard would I have not have been stayng there We fail to understand how AA as late as this year could rate this and similar type and standard hotel to more than 2 stars To give this hotel a 4 star rating is the same as misleading guests would almost say cheating guests who believe they have booked a 4 stars almost top class hotel When hotels like Hilton get 5 stars is this hotel no more than a 2 star hotel not even close to 3 stars 
Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were very small in one of the rooms there was mildew on the shower ceiling the window pane was cracked and the wood around the windows was mouldy Also there was nowhere to plug in the kettle other than on the floor by the bed In the other room the radiator did not work and the room felt damp 
Gainsborough Hotel, From walking in the entrance the decor looked like it could do with a freshen up The lift was very small and noisy Our room had a broken window pane The net curtain looked dirty The slash window would not close properly at the bottom and there was a huge air conditioning unit stuck on part of the window The curtains were off their tracks Tea and coffee ok The beds were extremely hard and very uncomfortable The lift shaft was right next to our bedroom wall Bathroom was tiny Definitely no room to swing a cat Continental breakfast was just about ok Worried by the fact that the fruit juices and milk was out without any cover or chilling Milk was warm The pastries were a bit stale Condiments also open to the elements Thought overall not value for money 
Gainsborough Hotel, The air conditioner was broken and the replacement free standing air conditioner was very noisy and placed near curtains which was a fire hazard The frint desk staff did not seem to know what to do
Gainsborough Hotel, This four star hotel is now just about a 2 star The hotel is now very tired and run down Very drab rooms appalling bathroom facilities Cracked floor tiles Cracked basin Awful shower No tea or coffee in the room A huge air con unit that looked like a 50 s fridge This hotel is in desparate need of a huge makeover I paid 125 for one night Rip off Even the reception resembles a miserable 50 s living room I was so glad to leave 
Gainsborough Hotel, All of above
Gainsborough Hotel, I asked for a quiet room but was given one on the front nearest to the busy road and the window would not shut I asked a member of staff to come and shut it for me but they couldn t shut ot for me either consequently I got almost no sleep
Gainsborough Hotel, The shower was a little small but you have to accept that in these old historic buildings 
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff was uncooperative and inexperienced Their knowledge about London was poor I also ask on reception for adapter however receptionist said that I can leave self phone to her for charging Next day I found out that they didn t charge it but they broke it In their opinion it wasn t their fault so they never payed repair but more importantly they never said sorry Next four days I tried to speak with manager but she never showed up I even try to make appointment in couple of occasions It was broken because someone from staff tried to plug the phone too violently My phone was standard android phone and I gave them my own android charger Probably they mixed up some of other incompatible charger with mine 
Gainsborough Hotel, No mattress protectors on the beds blankets rather than a duvet made for quite an uncomfortable night The room was very small but fine for just an overnight stay 
Gainsborough Hotel, The nail as shower handle was disconcerting but it worked well and frankly was better than the taps in some other hotels Really we didn t need to complain about anything and was an excellent start to our journey 
Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms very shabby and bathroom filthy Fire escape routes blocked by large laundry bags Receptionist looked like she really couldn t be bothered 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so small especially the bathroom We had to stack our suitcases on the floor surrounding the beds as there was no other place to put them 
Gainsborough Hotel, Checked in and received a twin room instead of a double room the hotel did not have any double rooms lefts that night and the guy at the counter could only offer us free continental breakfasts the next day to make up for it We already had breakfast plans so no thanks Plus he kept repeating it was also a superior room so it was the same Sorry but its not It s like if I order a steak at a restaurant then get a fish sure they may be the same price but its not what I ordered Not the best start to our vacation Breakfast is fair for the price I guess 7 for continental and 12 for full but pretty boring Just one type of ham and one type of cheese were offered plus some jams honey jogurt milk and cereals For the full breakfast there s a small menu with choice of eggs beans mushrooms etc but I d rather eat elsewhere There are tons of places nearby Beds are short both rooms and the comforter those standard camel hotel felts was just sandwiched between 2 sheets so the layers separated if you know what I mean The scratchy felt layer inevitably creeps onto your face at night Oh also genius members are supposed to get welcome drinks but that didn t happen 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small and the tv was in a difficult position to see 
Gainsborough Hotel, The local knowledge of eating places the smell in room 24 slightly smoky very small bathroom Shower attachment iffy 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room very small lift slow and not functioning very well The location of the hotel on your map was almost facing Hyde Park whereas in fact it is near the Old Brompton Road 
Gainsborough Hotel, Almost everything else Dismal basement room air con a tube through the window and noisy Bathroom grubby equipment old and tired wardrobe door jammed bed hard and creaky Overall a general air of shabbiness 
Gainsborough Hotel, For 7 the continental breakfast was not good value for money The fruit was tinned not fresh and there was no natural yoghurt only fruit flavoured 
Gainsborough Hotel, Bed is below all expectations No plug sockets next to bed Very noisy stand alone ac Stays directly next to the bed singe room Poor and expensive breakfast Very weak water pressure in a shower No toilet brush 
Gainsborough Hotel, Front of house on arrival very unhelpful and unfriendly rooms small very tired and dull cleanliness left a lot to be desired dust everywhere dirty wallpaper and the lift is something else so very small tiny infact quite suffocating Staying at the Gainsborough for one night is an experience I will never be repeating 
Gainsborough Hotel, The Reception is a disaster a nice lady who appears to be in total confusion I rang the hotel several times and the phone rang out with no one answering on two occasions The two big chairs in front of reception need moving and the reception area extending staff wander in and out interrupting the receptionist making the check in check out hard work Would help if person on duty could speak and understand english better
Gainsborough Hotel, They tried to fob me off with a twin room instead of the double room that I had booked They were rude and incompetent when dealing with the complaint and at no point issued an apology for the inconvenience Terrible hotel will never stay there again 
Gainsborough Hotel, Most of it 60dB air con I measured it TV didn t work uncomfy bed hard pillows tired and very small room wasn t asked how my stay was 
Gainsborough Hotel, There is free wifi but in is rather slow something that could be easily improved 
Gainsborough Hotel, Shower cubicle within the shower room was very old and tired looking I am sure it was clean but in dire need of renovation 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small The bed or the dressing table had to be removed if you needed to plug the kettle or hairdryer into a socket One of the beds had a huge dip around the upper body area Both mattresses were deemed to be uncomfortable 
Gainsborough Hotel, Checking In complete joke Deluxe Room only in the name Carpets stained Bathroom dirty
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel should be a four stars but it is hardly two My room was awful Too small dirty and really hot with a very noisy fresh air sistem Plus the bed was old and broken with the springs into my ribs 
Gainsborough Hotel, We liked the stay in Gainsbury and may be we will return another stay in London
Gainsborough Hotel, little space in the room and bathroom very old furnishing in short a london hotel room 
Gainsborough Hotel, Initially the room seemed very small It was but you can adjust The bathroom is tiny 
Gainsborough Hotel, Did not like our room in the basement as it was quite noisy but on saying that the room size was adequate The basement room we had just needs a paint job and a few other bits and pieces doing to it Would suit singles or younger people not too bothered by the noise very early in the morning staff all lovely and helpful 
Gainsborough Hotel, We stayed in room 410 it was tatty the air con was inadequate And the cold water ran out after a short shower so there wasn t any water to drink or make coffee 
Gainsborough Hotel, AC unit was very noisy which made it impossible to have it on by night Luckily the window could be opened instead The bathroom had a slightly funky smell which disappeared when the air had been on for a little while but came back again It would have been nice with a small dresser or just a couple of drawers to unpack into 
Gainsborough Hotel, Had to change the room in the middle of our stay because the staff was confused about our booking Slightly far away from London night life 
Gainsborough Hotel, There was a little mouse in the bedroom the staff told us that they thought they had eliminated that problem but they didn t do anything more 
Gainsborough Hotel, The area where we kept our clothes had a leak in the ceiling and then a mouse ran into our room Luckily it ran straight back out This was on our last night I complained to the reception who apologised Four days later I ve still not had an apology from the manager I expected an email at the least we had a 20 discount off the stay to recompense but still 
Gainsborough Hotel, I left lugage at the hotel Till now the hotel has not sent the package and has asked too much information about the credit card they are not in accordance with security requirements 
Gainsborough Hotel, Sound insulation is not good enough breakfast is ok but too simple not many kinds to choose 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was very tired Torn curtains large part of the bath enamel all chipped off door out to roof wouldn t shut lock just a chain lock for security Glad we were only there for 1 night 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room offered to us on the ground floor even though requested a high floor the room dust have a proper window view the room looked out the the boiler which was very warm 
Gainsborough Hotel, Very disappointing dark windowless triple room faulty air conditioning inadequate hairdryer and no mirror Price does not reflect this very basic hotel and the room lacked even the bare essentials to ensure a comfortable stay Certainly would not recommend and won t be returning 
Gainsborough Hotel, Our room a triple hardly had any sunlight and a strangely situated bathroom which makes sense in an old building But everything worked well and I know that triples don t tend to be the fanciest rooms in European hotels 
Gainsborough Hotel, Everything 
Gainsborough Hotel, No free wifi The beds were very hard and the pillows very flat 
Gainsborough Hotel, The air con didn t work it was a bit run down and not cleaned properly The beds were also not very comfortable I would rate this hotel as Max 3 stars

Gainsborough Hotel, The room had old furniture very dirty curtains and tired as well the breakfast wasnt fresh the overall building needs renovation not all the staff was helpful 
Gainsborough Hotel, Breakfast was poor asked 3 times did we want toast it took 30 minutes to come Very slow to replace foods when baskets empty The room was nice but could really do with an update 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room and en suite clean but very tired we shouldn t have had rain water leaking through the ceiling of one of our party should we 
Gainsborough Hotel, Not a complaint but a wee chocolate on the hospitality tray would have been great 
Gainsborough Hotel, First room offered was in basement with no natural light Second room had a window but only later realised the device in the middle of the floor with a vent pipe going across to the window was a fixture and meant to provide air conditioning It did cool the room but the noise was a health hazard Impossible to hear ourselves speak so we cooked instead There was obviously one in the next room too noise was terrible Room a bit shabby and could do with redecoration 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a bit hot and had to keep the air con on all night Hotel and rooms are a bit dated 
Gainsborough Hotel, Very old and worn out looking hotel Room was dusty and did not feel clean Shower and bathtub old and rusty Poorly ventilated
Gainsborough Hotel, It was shabby and in need of renovation It was the smallest room ever hardly room to walk around the bed Bathroom was tiny had cracked tiles and the overall impression is drab 
Gainsborough Hotel, The single room was like a cell with ripped furnishings and a portable aircon which you could not sleep through Very thin walls meant I could hear every snore from the next room The bathroom was so tiny that if you were large you would have trouble fitting in Included breakfast was a very average continental 
Gainsborough Hotel, The noise the air con made The television reception was terrible could not get most of the channels and when you could they were pixilated Room 303 
Gainsborough Hotel, Air conditioner in the room did not work probably not an issue for the UK most of the year Traditional UK plumbing shower that delivers cold scalding water randomly whats wrong with a thermostatic valve 
Gainsborough Hotel, First day i asked for Omelette but was not served Staff dint apologize also Dental kit was asked but not provided Continental breakfast was paid but only English breakfast provided
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff could barely speak enough English to understand our requests Ordered the wrong taxi for us which caused the driver problems Without most electricity for one day Gave us battery operated lamps but no price reduction Breakfast was horrible Not enough food and coffee was cold and order was wrong This was not the British hotel experience we expected when we chose this location Would not recommend this to anyone 
Gainsborough Hotel, The curtains were all torn the safety our bedroom windowwasground level we had to sleep with window locked very stuffy If you weighed more than 70 kg You could not fit I shower my husband had trouble squeezing into the opening 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, The air conditioner was hopeless in room Old unit was very noisy and didn t even cool room Going by previous complaints this is a problem in all the rooms Hotel needs to upgrade system 
Gainsborough Hotel, I suppose the price was quite reasonable for London so I am not complaining 
Gainsborough Hotel, D cor old tired Shower Air conditioning in our room was not very good
Gainsborough Hotel, Our double bed wasn t made up as such just twin beds pushed together with a cover thrown over So we basically slept in twin beds Floor needed hoovering 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel was quite tired and our room was dark and below street level The bathroom was very outdated and the shower was a hand held affair We were quite shocked to see that this was a four star hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, Beds a little uncomfortable need new soft pillows Single rooms dated Double good 
Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel is old and tired Simple things no spared power sockets for anything e g kettle phone charger or computer unless you unplug the table lamp TV etc 
Gainsborough Hotel, everything Facilities are poor Hotel is incredibly overpriced according to the quality one gets The shower doesn t work the rooms are tiny and extremely old 
Gainsborough Hotel, the Bed was very Bad Very narrow bed even though this room number 404 is for a couple the width of the bed was barely 140 cm the mattress sags in the middle then there is like a hole in the middle of the bed and we could not sleep well was Created like a sank in the middle of the bed We Wake up in the morning with back pain and muscle and very tired Very Bad Experience and we will never come back there Sorry but Not recommended Breakfast don t eat here by walking in the area you will find better options and cheaper 
Gainsborough Hotel, Pillows gave me a headache
Gainsborough Hotel, Taking into a c the age of the building I suppose a bit of an sympathetic modern update might spruce parts on view to its customers as nowadays interior design is very important 
Gainsborough Hotel, Although the pictures looked good The doble bed besides 1 35 cm wide Had been terribly unconfortable due to the hardnes eather of the mattress or the under bed somier We could not stand it
Gainsborough Hotel, Upon arriving to the Hotel for My Fianc e Birthday A concert at Wembley The Hotel for the night then afternoon tea at the Ritz Firstly the room was filthy there was rust all over the tap which looked like blood there was no Cold water so he had to brush our teeth with Hot Water the shower basin filled up with water very quickly and I had to turn it off twice wait for the water to drain before switching it back on The headboard was loose the bed was really uncomfortable I never complain but I felt as if this room 20 was totally not satisfactory and was the worst hotel experience of my life The paint from the celling was also falling down and the meagre window had filthy blinds 
Gainsborough Hotel, Dark basement room Small bedroom Did not need second bedroom Would have preferred larger room Bed not very comfortable Coffee at breakfast not good
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff accused my partner of been a lier when he said he had payed cash night before for drinks Once staff had checked what he had said several times yes He had payed cash and the apologies flowed Have never needed to write reviewsabout a hotels we have previously booked felt so strongly about this one 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bedroom was a twin rather than a double which I had requested and was very small although a big bathroom The headboard was broken and as a result the mattress didn t sit correctly on the base The lighting was poor barely enough to read by Disappointing breakfast with rather stale rolls and little choice 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room decor very dated Room on the small side in the basement Fixtures fittings in serious need of refurbishment 
Gainsborough Hotel, The double bed was small and my pillow not comfortable
Gainsborough Hotel, The one room we had was right off the elevator so there was noise from that Not really loud but if you were awake you could hear it 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, When we went upstairs there was an indefinable smell Our room was shabby and many things didn t work The water in the bathroom was a slow trickle We tried to open the blinds once up they would not come back down the cord was hung up on the top The lights in the bathroom didn t work and in the room itself they were little more than a feint glow The bed itself was very worn in and oddly comfortable which was the one plus The air conditioning was attached to the window in a strange tube structure that I ve never seen before and it fell out in the middle of the night 
Gainsborough Hotel, I didn t like that booking in had to be later than expected I didn t like not having a bedside table and the plug sockets were a bit difficult to sort out and one broken or blocked I think 
Gainsborough Hotel, Our room was tiny and very hot with poor a c which had a dreadful smell We opened the window instead but still stuffy and hot Bathroom tiny and dilapidated the hotel badly needs redecorating Staff and location mean we would stay again 
Gainsborough Hotel, Bed linen was filthy Room was small like a broom cupboard Shower cubicle was tight and blocked and gung coming up from it 
Gainsborough Hotel, Portable air con unit in the room that made a loud noise terrible shower that was freezing or red hot I walked out of the breakfast 
Gainsborough Hotel, The d cor was very tired Bathroom far too small and particularly neglected Bulbs did not work in bedside lamp or lamp above bathroom mirror 
Gainsborough Hotel, The rooms were somewhat disappointing in comparison to the facilities mentioned above In the double singles the mattresses were very uncomfortable Larger and more pillows are needed With two people in the room there should be a second towel in the bathroom Lastly instead of using a rigged very noisy air conditioning machine a standing quiet fan would do a better job to cool the room Not being able to draw the drapes allowed too much light in to sleep 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was a little bit uncomfortable but its tolerable 
Gainsborough Hotel, On arrival staff were un cooperative Room in basement We asked re window and were told a large window it was actually small and looked onto steps from street Luggage left near hotel doorway and not secured 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was old fashioned with a huge Ac unit stuck in the window My room was through a fire door and on its own at the top of some stairs which made me feel unsafe We asked if they could order a taxi for us as there was a storm we were told we should go out and find a taxi I also object to paying 20 extra in case I use something in the hotel and then have to wait up to 2 weeks to get it back 
Gainsborough Hotel, the bathroom can do with an update but overall the single room was quite spacious a fire alarm went off by mistake in the really early morning so after that sleeping was difficult 
Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms and I was shown a few are tired Could be a great Boutique Hotel but would need a lot of money spending on it 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room too hot Fire alarm woke us up at 4 30am Apparently faulty alarm that was yet to be fixed Staff did not know enough about London to be able to help us with directions 
Gainsborough Hotel, One of the worst hotels I have ever been to The hotel is rated as 4 stars hotel but everything from the main entrance to the room is 2 stars From the begining the hotel wellcomes you with very dirty and very worn out carpet In the room the furniture is very old and worn the walls are cracked and peeled The bathroom is very small I almost did not fit inside the shower tube and the water was almost impossible to adjust The washbasin was cracked The lights in the bathroom half were not working and the other half were blinking Over the night we felt like we are in the army We had 4 fire alarms false alarms every one two hours We could not sleep at all At 4 30 after the last alarm when I decided is useless to try to sleep again I went out to smoke One of the hotels employee saw me at the reception and asked me What is wrong you can t sleep When finally the breakfast time came we were again disappointed Another reason to be angry It was a maximum 2 strars breakfast Literally at a so called 4 stars hotel breakfast we had bread one type of cheese one type of tiny croissants jam and filter coffe Even 3 stars hotels offers you eggs pastrami sausages a few types of croissants espresso coffe This is a 2 stars hotel Is your decision if you ever book this hotel but if you do it now you know what to expect from a so called 4 stars hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, 3am fire alarms EVERY NIGHT If you like a good nights sleep do not stay here The staff were rude when I complained No discount for broken sleep not even after 2 nights of fire alarms going off twice a night Not a good place 
Gainsborough Hotel, Really small room Curtains wired to rail and would not shut Safe battery dead No bedside lamp only overhead Room so small I could not open door fully b c of floor fan Low water pressure b c of fourth floor location 
Gainsborough Hotel, Small single room Limited tea coffee facilities in room Very warm room despite fan being available Room was clean but pokey for the price 
Gainsborough Hotel, I did not like the basement which is where they put us not impressed very little natural light and very dismal Booked way in advance and no where near full so extremely disappointed 
Gainsborough Hotel, No hooks in the bathroom Only one chair in the bedroom Room was cold when we arrived and only one small blanket on the bed 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was damp with peeling wallpaper The net curtains were dirty and the shower room was poor loose wires and a giant step into and out of the shower and ordinary light switch in the bathroom to operate the extractor fan and sink lights The kettle had to be on the floor plugged into an extension lead The bedside lamps didn t work The double bed was two singles made up as two singles and pushed together 
Gainsborough Hotel, We arrived at 14 00 as we had a lunch in Chelsea booked at 15 00 but the room wasn t ready They did however get a room prepared relatively quickly 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was very poor I was trapped in the shower when I closed the shower door as it had no release handle on the inside If my friend had not been in the bedroom I would have been there until the cleaners arrived Very scary the door could not have been checked properly when the room was prepared prior to occupation The matter was dealt with 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in a terrible condition Dirty carpets and shabby walls The room was around 5 feet wide so completely unsuitable for a small family and not fit for purpose More importantly there was an electric socket in the bathroom which not permitted for health and safety reasons
Gainsborough Hotel, Tiniest room I have ever seen in my life Had to climb over the bed to get from one side to the other Couldn t close the bathroom door whilst on the toilet because it was too close to the wall and there was no room Could step out of bed and reach the toilet in 1 step really pleasant for a romantic break Not big enough for a broom cupboard let alone humans 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room resembled a cell Tea Coffee provision were really limited Lighting was poor Bed and pillows had seeno better days 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel was located well hotel entrance really nice but room was very shabby and dated Marks on carpet bathroom tiles cracked and shower cubicle was just awful Would not stay again 
Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing
Gainsborough Hotel, The room we were put in was off to the side and as it was looked as if it was a broom cupboard turned into a room it was over looking good the air conditioning unit and the bathroom was in a poor state We also booked a room with a double bed and we had 2 singles put together The wallpaper was coming off the walls and the headboard looked dirty The room was totally dated and just was very dim Wooden toilet seat which I find to be totally unhygienic They asked us upon check in for a 20 deposit on top of our tarriff on the room Just in case we had a drink at the bar or ordered food We explained that we wouldn t as we were there for one night and would be out We were told that there is a block on the money and of we don t use it the money would then be returned to our card in 3 to 5 business days Not acceptable one bit If I didn t use the money then I should be reimbursed immediately I was not happy about this Why should they keep my unspent money at all We went and got the cash 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room very small couldn t open the window or blinds They air con didnt work but a fan was provided felt a bit claustrophobic Dont take a ground floor room 
Gainsborough Hotel, Very poor room cracked sink stained carpet rattling old window hotel fully aware of this but still happy to place customers in this quality of room 
Gainsborough Hotel, Rooms are little tired but were comfortable and suitable
Gainsborough Hotel, Limited facilities No catering and bar so when we arrived at lunchtime we had to go out to find a sandwich Breakfast could have been more inspiring even though we were aware it was only going to be a continental breakfast Very little atmosphere in hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, Crack in bathroom basin Wallpapering not finished in bedroom and what was wasn t very good Old and shabby decor throughout 
Gainsborough Hotel, As above breakfast too expensive this was continental 
Gainsborough Hotel, The shower in the first room we stayed in had no water pressure and you couldn t set it to a proper temperature In this way you could only choose to shower ice cold or boiling hot After telling the receptionist we were told that maintenance will take care of it while we were out sightseeing After returning the shower problem still hadn t been fixed and we were moved to another room which had a new shower but was located next to the noisy elevator Oh well if it wasn t for the price we payed for this hotel definitely too much for what you get I would say it was all acceptable 
Gainsborough Hotel, Shower pressure very low The room rate should have included breakfast not charged as an extra No bar or amenities which is disappointing 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room slightly small but good enough for me Bathroom sink did not have a plug But a very minor point
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in the basement so rather dark and looking up at the street where everyone walked past The cost on Booking com for two nights was 214 pounds without breakfast or 234 pounds with breakfast I opted for the latter i e 20 pounds for two breakfasts but they told me this only entitled me to the continental breakfast which cost only 7 pounds I would thus have been better off only booking the room through Booking com and paying for breakfast on arrival I pointed this out and they replied that i was getting a very reasonable room rate so should not complain 
Gainsborough Hotel, Could have had a better shower but it is only a minor complaint
Gainsborough Hotel, 1 the room had a flimsy perspex panel in the window instead of glass this allowed a lot of noise in from the street noise only really noticeable in the evening 2 the toilet shower room was quiet narrow meaning it wasn t the easiest place to dry yourself down in 
Gainsborough Hotel, Bed Comfort not good no duvet two sheets only Bathroom Fittings Low quality Located on ground floor view from window of boiler size of room was small and unimpressive small size breakfast items bread crissiants etc owner looking to save money 
Gainsborough Hotel, not that i didnt like it it was fantastic value for money but it was shabby and old fashioned shower didnt work properly so had to have a bath which didnt bother me but if i was there on business would have found the extra time it took annoying 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room looked nothing like those I saw when I booked on line I thought I had paid for a decent double room not two single beds pushed together and small space to get into hanging space for clothes The room had some kind of matching that was not fixed properly to the window and took up space
Gainsborough Hotel, Very disappointed that we paid for room including breakfast but was only continental It does not say that on booking com You would expect a full English for the price we paid Also the shower was very poor 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a little bit small for a couple but was sufficient for purpose 
Gainsborough Hotel, Dirty poorly maintained poor standard of workmanship lift rarely working we were on the fourth floor and staff downright rude when I reported the lift not working also made to wait when checking out because the receptionist was trying to overcharge another guest Never again 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room needed paint 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was small with a very large TV which was situated in an awkward position There were electric points but they were difficult to access especially to use the kettle
Gainsborough Hotel, the continental breakfast at 12 00 per person was excessive A better value breakfast was available at Carluccios near south Kensington station for 9 95
Gainsborough Hotel, It would have been good to have a bedside table for both guests One or two areas were still dusty 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room could have done with redecorating all felt very tired Floor tiles in bathroom were cracked and bath had been re painted didn t encourage one to useit 
Gainsborough Hotel, Booked a triple room for us and our 8year old granddaughter only to find on arrival that all triple rooms were windowless I think that this should be stipulated on booking On checking with reception we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back of the biulding and were without windows We were offered a family room with a supplement of 30 or a superior double room with childs camp bed we chose the latter not wanting to incur more cost we considereded 145 we had already paid for a triple room to be enough We were particularly annoyed that our daughter was staying in a superior double room for 115 so ineffect we paid 30 fo a very small camp bed and what turned out to be a very cramped room The next morning we went to make a cup of tea and the long life milk pins were rancid They were out of date by 2 months Poor show and lack of housekeeping Situation saved by the very pleasant staff working on the morning of Sunday 3rd 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was tiny but that was fine as I only slept there
Gainsborough Hotel, The only thing i would say is that the room could have been a little bigger 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room d cor skirting board looked like it hadn t been painted for years marks all over the walls 
Gainsborough Hotel, The walls were a bit thin but not much you can do about that Pre authorization of my credit card upon arrival with an additional 60 It was removed when checking out so no problem as such but I wish I had known about this routine before I arrived 
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is in need of refurbishment we had an awful view out of our window over an area which was dirty and neglected The bathroom was very old and in need of replacing The bedroom smelt of smoke although it did seem clean The receptionist wanted ID from both of us not a legal requirement As well as telling us they had to take an advanced authorisation on my debit card for and extra 50 on top of the room charge We refused hotels haven t tried this for years More of a B B than a hotel and definitely not 4 star 
Gainsborough Hotel, It was difficult to have a shower as the shower would not fit onto the hook however we managed 
Gainsborough Hotel, Just before we check out we saw clean towels were left on the ground near the elevator by one of the accommodation staff where any one could have stept on it skirting is dirty we can t imagine if we were using the towel we took a pic of it and showed the picture to the receptionist hopefully hotel can address this issue soon 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was shabby shower had two options fires of hell or cryogenics I also didn t like the fact that very few of the guests were paying customers most people at the hotel were being provided temporary accommodation by the government paying for their stay This changed the atmosphere of the hotel into a hostel for the displaced and vulnerable 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room could be cleaner bed was very squeaky No extra roll of toilet paper Big deposit and still reserved after 4 days of checkout but there was no minibar so why take deposit Please return asap No sound isolation so could hear neighbors talking and laughing at night Bad wifi signal No socket to charge phone near the bed and only one free socket so you couldn t charge 2 phones at once 
Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel is not a 4 star hotel it is between a 2 3 star Old and worn furniture dusty curtains Cannot close a window properly I expected a small room but a better standard from 90 night
Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel very down at heel definitely in need of a total facelift Shower so small it was almost impossible to turn around in it and I m a small person Not very clean 
Gainsborough Hotel, The heating was not on when we arrived so it was cold The bed was small the pillows were hard and the curtains were torn on the outside The room was in the basement 
Gainsborough Hotel, Not at all a 4star hotel more like a 2 Terrible Broken hairdryer stained carpets mouldy bathroom cabinet electric wires all over the floor nails screws sticking out from the skirting boards wallpaper coming off the walls Broken shower Cooked Breakfast comes from the hotel across the road So it was cold and disgusting Definitely not worth the money I had booked it as a celebration I was planning on proposing to my boyfriend and it was our friends birthday Totally ruined due to crappy hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, Sink Water in bathroom you have one cold water tap one hot water tap but no mix So either you wash your teeth with cold water or burning water shower ok though Room not so clean A bit noisy at nights from traffic 
Gainsborough Hotel, Noise of room on ground floor sounded like a boiler was in constant use ALL night and room temp fluctuated
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was in need of some TLC It is due refurbishment but guess this is reflected in the price We couldn t turn off the room radiator but this was dealt with promptly 
Gainsborough Hotel, Very small and old poorly working lift small corridor small room very very small bathroom congested shower area even difficult to stand Uncomfortable bed Poorly located LCD TV 
Gainsborough Hotel, We felt the hotel was lovely but it was tired and could do with a paint and redecoration
Gainsborough Hotel, Overall a little worn at the edges but quite functional The inclusive breakfast is an ok continental one which does not vary Cooked breakfast is charged extra 
Gainsborough Hotel, Curtains falling off but able to wrap over window area to keep out light There is a small bar area but at no time were we encouraged to use it They might make more money if they mentioned it to the guests 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was in the basement right underneath the road including all noises that come with such a location with single glazing accommodation The room and interior was in such a bad state esp the bathroom that we cannot understand how this can be seriously offered to any customer 
Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing to complaint
Gainsborough Hotel, Condition of the room No natural light in the room The room which was on the first floor right next to elevator shaft which wasn t too noisy thankfully was a bit of an odd layout The one thing you noticed as soon as you entered the room was that there was barely any natural light in the room as it only had a 18inch square window above a door where you d expect a window to be The door where the window should be was actually the entrance to the bathroom There was plenty of natural light there so the only option was to leave the bedroom door open The room was a triple as we d requested and although my bed was on the squidgy side they were fine and the linen was clean Next to my sons bed there was a large patch of wallpaper missing where somebody had torn it away and the drawers next to my bed where broken with one drawer not shutting and the other had it s front broken off but just leaning against it Tea making was fun as you had to plug it in on the floor after removing the tray from the beneath the TV I realise that this review seems negative it is sad as it wouldn t take much effort to make it a really nice hotel but I find it surprising that it s rated as a 4 star due to all the issues I found I can t comment on the food as we ate breakfast and all other meals out in Kensington We still had a successful trip as we only spent our sleeping hours there Sad to say but I wouldn t stay at the Gainsborough again 
Gainsborough Hotel, I didn t have any hot water in my shower one morning but the other 4 mornings were fine 
Gainsborough Hotel, Heating in the rooms very poor random time turned on Hard mattresses on bed Most staff did not speak English and neither spoke German French Bathroom taps of cold and hot water separate so washing hands either too hot or too cold Shower without pressure All carpeted floors with carpets needing some cleaning or replacement Charged breakfast for kids aged 6 
Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel lobby is tired looking as was entrance area to my room Very small room indeed advertised as a double but really it is a single Shower unit too small and I am petite a larger person certainly couldn t shower in it Side table lamp not working nor was the safe Room carpet had stains on as did the over cover on the bed Building work noises constantly from the next building starting early ending late Room 114 backs onto a busy school playground If you do want to use this room ask for a big discount as it s certainly not worth anywhere near what they are charging good location or not 
Gainsborough Hotel, Poor shower and a stale cigarette smell in the bathroom 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room we stay in the bathroom lock isnt working and there was a 80 additional deposit required which was quite redundant when we ddidn t want to pay for additional services
Gainsborough Hotel, The door can t even be fully closed The staff knocked on our door at 8am Saturday to ask if room service is needed Of course not now Then they never came back the room is not cleaned up at all during our stay 2 days 
Gainsborough Hotel, view from the room was not very nice junk thrown outside of the window The bathroom was not very clean
Gainsborough Hotel, The toilet seat was broken in the deluxe room and the wall paper was coming off the walls The carpets were stained and the room was very dirty and dusty 
Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so hot but in order to turn down the heat you had to speak to staff It would have been great to have easier independent access 
Gainsborough Hotel, Hotel s facilities are very old and need be refurbished For example flush in the toilet was very weak we asked staff to fix it but even after the fix flush did not begin to work properly One of the window sections was not able to be closed completely in January and we also request hotel s staff to fix this issue 
Gainsborough Hotel, The decor in my single room was a tad shabby Not in a Chic way 
Gainsborough Hotel, We were welcomed very well The room we found very small But we were only there one night We had great difficulty plugging the kettle in as the lead was short the plug adaptor was on the floor The room was clean the bed was clean We did miss having a bar of soap in bathroom but otherwise it was ok 
Gainsborough Hotel, Dreadful smell in room a cross between paint and something in the air con system it smelt toxic upon entering every time although I did get used to it Renovators directly above my room started each day at approx 8 30 9am Incessant drilling hammering walking about and dropping tools Very small bathroom this was fine but amenities in wrong positions a badly planned bathroom Mould in shower alcove Decor is dark and needs modernising blankets on bed need upgrading to doonas Room very cold although central heating was on very noisy extra blanket provided upon request 
Gainsborough Hotel, Bed was a little too firm for me shower floor was a bit slippery hot water from shower rather sparse on 3rd floor probably everyone else using it at the same time 
Gainsborough Hotel, The accommodation was let down by the bathroom which was cold and in need of refurbishment Poor shower and both basin and bath plugs had come loose and were on the shelf Not good enough for a 4 hotel 
Gainsborough Hotel, Out of date Hotel Everything is old badly maintained with poor quality They gave us a safety pin to close the broken window curtains during the night 
Gainsborough Hotel, Public areas were very nice but room we were allocated was very disappointing for a romantic weekend Decor and furnishings seemed very dated and was more like a single room than a double Bed was two singles pushed together and only one bedside cabinet Buffet breakfast area at 9 30 am on a Sunday was poorly stocked and seating inadequate Dining chairs are far too cumbersome with tables used Should consider bistro seating Staff were pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of them Perhaps maybe coordination regard seating of guests and restocking of buffet table should be addressed We had to wait for coffee milk juice and had no pastries 
Gainsborough Hotel, We arrived 10 minutes early for a 2pm check in Our deluxe room was not available so we were given a room for 3 as an apparent upgrade It was awful room was dirty the shower didn t work lighting was terrible and the double bed was two twin beds put together I wanted to complain but the missus said to just leave it The staff were friendly enough but struggled with basic english Whoever gave this 4 stars needs sectioning Do not stay here 
Gainsborough Hotel, See above
Gainsborough Hotel, Although we had been upgraded our room was still very basic Our toilet flusher was broken and bathroom was tired looking needed some tlc
Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was hard The bathroom was adequate but tired and needs maintaining or refurb Eg Wobbly loo cracked floor tiles 
Gainsborough Hotel, The lady at reception asked for passport details which were not explained in the booking Bathroom very dated and dirty
Gainsborough Hotel, I did not like the fact that we were asked for ID on arrival then asked again an hour later Why do I need to carry my passport if im a UK citizen in a UK hotel If it was so important why were not given ample notice of this To say it was in thes mall print was a very poor response 
Gainsborough Hotel, We paid for a superior double room and got given a standard twin Although this was rectified had we not liked the alternative room we would have had to stay in a room we were originally assigned which was not what we paid for 
Gainsborough Hotel, Only vice was the room was VERY warm Couldn t turn the heating down and couldn t open the window as it was terribly windy outside 
Gainsborough Hotel, Should be good to have any more shelves in the bathroom and inside the wardrobe 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was small and decorations and furniture tired Fine if you want a hotel to sleep in and not much more which we did 
Gainsborough Hotel, Shown to a basic twin room first when i had booked a delux double had to complain to get appropriate room English breakfast was cooked across the road as there is no kitchen not good 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was in desperate need of maintenance upgrading The water pipes were Knocking the room was dark the facilities were poor and the staff were ambivalent to Customers 
Gainsborough Hotel, My room was basically a dorm room absolutely tiny and very old It was so cold I had to sleep in my clothes and coat Also in the folder it states food served until 10 I got back 9pm and kitchen was already closed I hadn t eaten allay and even the sister hotel which I did not know had most of the facilities had also closed Staff pointed out other eateries but I was very pregnant and exhausted from work 
Gainsborough Hotel, I had a large crack running up my wall that seemed to be the reason why the Bathroom door wouldn t close properly Also the air conditioning machine was at a very odd angle 
Gainsborough Hotel, Terrible shower loose taps handle missing from hair dryer drawer Generally a bit shabby and in need of improvements 
Gainsborough Hotel, The decor and rooms could do with a little upgrade
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is very veery tired the rooms are small the shower in our room was a joke with no pressure and going cold then hot then cold again the AC did not work the bed was tiny for a double All in all not very good at all 
Gainsborough Hotel, Initially directed to room with just a normal double bed having booked a standard twin room This was quickly rectified Room at the rear of the premises was clean though a little shabby Quiet at night and allowed for a good nights sleep 
Gainsborough Hotel, only complaint would be the small shower and lack of water pressure Bit of a squeeze to get in and shower controls keep moving as one turns in the shower to get wet Very noisy mornings 
Gainsborough Hotel, The breakfast is quite traditional and could be a bit more modern i e some sliced vegetables for the bread and less sweet youghurt A bit draughty room which made it a bit cold at night 
Gainsborough Hotel, Booked double room got twin 104 Both bath tap sink tap had very loose parts Bath very slippery when wet but no grab handles 
Gainsborough Hotel, They gave me room 401 it is behind a firedoor and cut off from the rest of the hotel and therefore the hotel heating does not affect this room There is a heater in the room it was not working and the room was freezing cold I complained someone came up to look at it then said that they d have to call maintenance in the morning No offer to exchange the room etc Next morning the shower took 15 20 min to warm up and was a trickle at best This time they offered that I shower in a different room By this time all I wanted to do was to get out of the musty freezing room At the reception there was no apology they charged me 89 gbp for a night in a small cold room even at this bargain price it was not worth it I could have been a frequent traveller with them and could have recommended this hotel to others at work who stay in London 2 3 nights every single week I will never stay there again 
Gainsborough Hotel, Was sligtly put off prior to travelling by some reviews Yes the reception staff was foreign who isn t in London They were very polite and very approachable Ignore bad reviews You will not be disappointed 
Gainsborough Hotel, Not a bad experience but needs updating especially the bathroom bath leaked quite badly Top of wardrobe was very dusty which we only noticed when recovering suitcase Biscuits would have been good along with the tea and coffee 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, The worst thing is that there was no central heating in late October In addition there was a 12 cm long hole in the window frame The room was cold Heater was provided upon request but nothing about the hole was done The furniture is worn out the bathroom is so tiny you need to squeeze into the shower 
Gainsborough Hotel, Room was very small although that was made clear when I booked Slightly quirky but very comfortable stay Pricey because of the school holidays but ultimately I d go back if it was a little more reasonable 
Gainsborough Hotel, Staff were helpful enough but seemed to lack understanding The room was very small even for a twin and there was limited space in the bathroom to have washing items touthpaste and toothbrush left out There was a bulb out in the wall lights and this was never replaced The hanging area was down a set of stairs but the light switch was at the bottom near the entrance door so we had to leave the night on all night for safety The bedroom was right next to the AC fans and it sounded as if we were sleeping on a boat We came back from one outing to discover that house keeping had left the window wide open which would allow anyone access to our room and items we had purchased On one morning when we exited the room which was next to the laundry cupboard we were met with 6 housekeeping staff spralled on the floor and on top of laundry bags not what paying guests want to see We opted not to have breakfast as in most cases it is easier to purchase and cheaper at a nice cafe however we were giving complimentary coffee on arrival but it was awful coffee All in all we were disappointed with the room and facilities and that there seemed to be no management available for complaint to 
Gainsborough Hotel, Not the happiest of staff but all ok 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathrooms were not bad 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bathroom was very small
Gainsborough Hotel, The hotel is in a very poor state I had safety concerns I have used this hotel before but won t again The furnishings are threadbare wallpaper is missing from the walls in places and the carpets are stained 
Gainsborough Hotel, Nothing but we should mention that there was a step up from our bedroom to the bathroom if someone has mobility problems 
Gainsborough Hotel, The bed was very hard not comfortable Pillows very lumpy Eiderdown smelt and was full of stains on underside and very grubby on topside Water in shower hard to control temperature and bath all lime scale marked Only 2 sachets of coffee in room 
Gainsborough Hotel, I has single room and was very very tiny too tiny to spend much time in there apart from sleep no room for a chair so had to sit on the bed Very traditional
Gainsborough Hotel, Our triple room had no window this had been closed over to create the bathroom There was borrowed light but as soon as the bathroom door was closed it left the room rather dark Also no mirror in the bedroom only in the bathroom Not ideal in a triple room Finally no gin available in the bar 
Gainsborough Hotel, As above
Gainsborough Hotel, The room we paid for was not like the one on booking com we were so tired that we slept in the room we were allocated we complained the next morning and changed rooms the bed was so uncomfortable Then in our next room the bed was also so hard the mattress was a lot smaller than the base 
Gainsborough Hotel, Booked a double room 4 months in advance Only had twin room next to a noisy elevator when arrived on time At various times the cold water stopped working and the electricity went out Filthy bedcovers Only salvation of this place is the location Conclusion avoid if you can 
Gainsborough Hotel, There was no mini bar or hair dryer In the room and our door had about an inch gap on the bottom so light and sound from the hallway came in freely 
Gainsborough Hotel, Hard to communicate with some reception staff English obviously not their 1st language bedroom decor furniture tired dated curtain track damaged window cracked wallpaper old marked furniture old and poorly mended with visible screws bedspread grubby 1 feather 3 foam pillows requested 2nd feather after 1st night but it never arrived bed could feel dents in mattress bizarrely no duvet but old fleece blanket sandwiched between TWO top sheets bathroom ok used bath foam shower gel 1st night requested replacement eventually butler arrived with shampoo around 11 30pm 
Gainsborough Hotel, A old tired hotel with old tired funiture much in need of repair with tired staff who are only just courteous cold rooms no central heating working outside temperature 8 c only a small electric fire for heat 
Gainsborough Hotel, Through no fault of my own I had to change my dates to the next day and was told that I could not get a refund for the day I didn t stay there Yes I know it s in the small print but I am a 70 year old who isn t really used to booking anything on line and didn t spot it My excuse was genuine and I think it was pretty mean of them I am a pensioner and 75 means a lot to me Therefore I won t ever book this hotel for any future visits to London Poor show Gainsborough If you change your mind I ll write something nice about you 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative

Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, Don t expect a 4 star hotel by American standards it would be a 3 star at best which seems to be the standard one less star than American standards Reserved and paid for a deluxe double room and the a c didn t work maintenance never came to address it even though the helpful staff tried to reach the department again Room was tired and dated in appearance although very clean Although deluxe and a supposed best buy our room didn t include a 12 pp breakfast 
Gainsborough Hotel, I specifically asked for twin beds but they gave a double bed Very awkward as they said the hotel was full and so they could not do anything 
Gainsborough Hotel, After the 3rd room we looked at found a room acceptable though in a poor state of repair Only good thing the window opened Bathroom in bad state repair Hotel tired Staff friendly but ill trained and fed up with complaints Embarassed One room we looked at rejected looked as though it was being de fleaed Shame of it is the hotel could be nice with a refit and is in a good location 
Gainsborough Hotel,No Negative
Gainsborough Hotel, It is not a 4 stars hotel it could be considered a 2 stars The rooms are very poor old and messy 
Gainsborough Hotel, For single travellers this is more like a two star definitely not a four and a bad two star at that On checking in I could barely understand the person at the check in desk For some reason she insisted on rubbing it in I was not going to be charged for an early check in which I had not asked for anyway I was expecting to use the luggage storage facility which by the way is just the area in the general vicinity of the check in desk She also assumed I was going to use room service and wanted me to pre pay a 5 charge Had to say no on more than one occasion I was in a single room on 3rd floor this was actually through door listed as stairs to reception no mention of my room number and basically looks like it was just a spare bit of space they had on a landing Had no wardrobe space as filled with large floor fan and a luggage support no room to put these in room anyway shelf was filled with a safe No drawers at all Had to sit on bed to open bathroom door as no space to walk by Window was broken with a temporary repair that had been there for a while Shower was disgusting with a rusting shower head mould round the bottom and the tiles had heavy lime scale water marks all over suggesting not cleaned properly in a long long time shower doors very stiff and did not like to force them closed suggesting that no one else wanted to use it either I counted two light switches in the bathroom one above the door and one for the wall mounted hair dryer are these even legal Dust on bottom edge of wardrobe at the side some one could not be bothered to reach down the side of the wall to remove it Bed cover was actually a double folded in half and valance ripped albeit on the wall side Limited tea coffee and only two milk and cup provided was very small giving you a very strong coffee with not enough milk to make drinkable The television was plugged into a multi socket extension which was hanging in mid air

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, the room was old and dated holes in the carpet windows you could not see out of unless standing on your tip toes and a very long walk and 2 lifts to the bedroom
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Rooms filthy and dirty stains all over the carpets walls and furniture Stale smell of urine in rooms Extra charge for parking of 5 a day Bathroom and shower were discusting refurbed rooms are better with more modern decor and bathrooms but still same old stained carpet Old and outdated decor Two seperate lifts to reach different floors witb long walk between lifts No concierge service to help with luggage 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Mould in the bathroom and around the window in the bedroom Had to usetwo lifts to get to the second floor with a 60 metre walk between lifts Just no good 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Was disappointed room booked for 2 people only had one hand towel and one bath towel in room For money paid for room was not satisfied with their service 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Trip hazard in room poorly fitted carpet Attitude of staff on reception No clean glasses Hot breakfast was not hot
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Room nothing like photos on website Every piece of Furniture need replacing very poor Hairdryer and phone very dated no fridge Chair in room stained Mold in bathroom on the tiles old shower No hot or cold on top of the taps
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, In the room is a take away menu which states it can be ordered after 10pm After seeing central London and eating fairly late we decided we would grab something off that menu Unfortunately when we called through we were told nothing was available by the kitchen Called back to reception who informed me they must ve run out the night before Breakfast time the staff were a little offish and I overheard one say to another come on get the plates moved I m not having them sitting here just chatting I cannot understand why we experienced both of these situations as the hotel was actually very quiet with what seemed only a handful of guests 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room was very dated and shabby and dirty around Windows the floor in the bathroom was sticky and scruffy and short of towels We also had to pay for breakfast and parking which we thought was included 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, As above
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The window to my room could not be opened It was warm and stuffy throughout the night although the little fan in the room did lessen the suffering somewhat The walk to the room is very far and I cannot imagine using this hotel if I am any older or in the next couple of years when my legs and knees weaken with age It didn t help went the access card to the room didn t work twice as it is sensitive and could not be placed near mobile phones 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I have stayed at this hotel before and normally everything is fine on this occasion the PC responsible for coding the key cards was not working so no access to your room without a member of staff accompanying you to unlock it the kitchen were unable to do any food due to a problem with the gas and presumably this is the reason why there was also no hot water I understand that things do go wrong but I don t accept that it couldn t have been fixed over the time period it happened Also the staff didn t seem to know what was going on communication could have been better 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Very tacky dated hotel soiled carpets bathroom fittings that were damaged No free car park even at night Time for some investors to completely refurbish this hotlel
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Disgusting dirty poor quality fittings damaged sanity units and shower smells Mound in rooms including window bugs seriously overpriced 1 not 4 Customer service awful no air conditioning dirty bathrooms carpets skirting nothing positive to say oh and food don t go there I spend a lot of time in hotels and this has to be the worst 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Dirty worn overpriced no air conditioning mound in room bugs damage sanity wear in bathroom horrendous seriously overpriced and poor customer service Not one to complain but awful 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Paying for parking and not having an armchair in bedroom 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rate quoted over the phone was 134 for an Executive room The receptionist was not willing to honour the Booking com online price of 114 and was very confused about what type of rooms were available to the point of almost arguing with me So I left the call and booked online receiving an Executive room for 114 Strange process and not very customer friendly approach
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The layout of the hotel means that you have to go in two lifts and walk loads to even get to your room carrying your bags Food for room service or in the restaurant was very poor choice and poor quality
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The photos showed on booking com are the 33 refurbished rooms If you don t specifically ask for one you end up in a horribly dated room We ended up moving rooms as the dated room was hideous 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Nothing really to do with the Hotel infact it stands as an oasis within it s environment it s simply the extent and unrelenting density of traffic one has to endure in order to get there having said which I would guess that going further into London to find more central accomodation would be even more intolerable arriving at the Hotel by car any further travel is probably best undertaken by TfL 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Paying for parking even though we was guests The exterior is shabby we had a long walk and two lifts to our rooms our room was dark with very little lighting in the room no air con could not open the windows very shabby bathroom The light on the dressing table did not work so had to get ready with very dim light No beer in the bar and the wine was awful The garden was a mess with napkins on the floor tables not cleared no table service Guest asleep at one table Noise of refurb across the whole hotel alarms going off Very poor breakfast when we came down there was very little food on the counters once we had finished our breakfast they had restocked greasy cheap sausages cheap bread Just very poor quality all round from a 4 star Could not wait to leave 3 star at best 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Suprised that there were no chairs in a superior room that we had to contribute towards parking 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I understand that they are currently updating the hotel but Stains on carpet no aircon in rooms it gets very hot during the day even with the fan going constantly pillows were very hard breakfast on the second morning was ok but the sausages weren t cooked properly and still looked pink whereas the morning before they were all browned off nicely I think they were having issues with the chef as I could overhear conversations between staff Room was good for what I needed one thing that annoyed me was the toiletries shampoo shower wash and body lotion were all half empty and the dressing table was sticky with ring marks but I cleared That up myself Hotel does need to updated and so do carpets in rooms I m a hotelier so maybe I m being a bit more picky 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I stayed in a room which was in the church end of the building I know it is an old building so accept the windows were as old as the building but because of this there was mildew on the window concrete frames I expect this to look old but not with mildew This could definitely have been cleaned and was not due to the fact that it was old but due to the fact that needed cleaning better I am 65 and have been cleaning areas of houses for a number of years and know what I saw could be cleaned The room smelt constantly of mildew and the smell did make me heave after sleeping in their for the night if I was in another part of the building I am sure my stay would have been perfect Now I have mentioned this I am sure it will be cleaner in the future I have pictures but cannot work out how to download from my phone 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The layout of the hotel and the fact lifts were not centralised 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, 3 fire alarms in same night function goers who hadn t paid for the use of a bar stood drinking and being rowdy in the car park late at night with their pre bought booze Decor badly needs updating
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bar area lacked any atmosphere and is very basic
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The decor of the room was dated from the 80 s 90 s the shower area had two different types of tiles on the walls There was unpainted repair work on the room walls I had always thought it was a highly maintained hotel but clearly not felt pretty disappointed to be honest There was a wedding the day we arrived at 5pm and we were lucky to get a parking space which then cost 5 because we had booked through Booking com The receptionist said if we d booked the room directly through the hotel the parking would of been free 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The size of the room was not a double the view was a car park and brick wall the shower was big enough to wash a child having to pay for car park a racial comment made by another guest and when informed manager she did nothing a phone call two hours before check in to tell me they are over booked basically because they had a wedding party
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Breakfast was vastly overpriced at 16 per person most expensive bowl of cereal my 12 year old has ever had I had bacon mushrooms egg and tomatoes for breakfast bacon VERY well cooked and egg rubbery Not enough milk on the table to have 2 x cups of coffee without asking for more We took the stairs to our room as the guy carrying a large parcel we had with us commandeered the lift Personally I prefer to use the stairs but would have been nice to be asked especially as I was carrying our case 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Bar facilities poor and lacking in insuffient and experinced staff Bar closing at 11 00pm is a ridiculous time for a hotel of this kind Asked for vegetarian breakfast at point of booking and there wasn t any 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, This hotel states they have plenty of free parking It s a lie To add insult when showing the reference to their quote on booking com l was told and l quote free parking is free subject to availability However as we ve sold the parking rights to an outside contractor there is no free parking available I am a frequent business traveller and never normally write reviews However l promised the receptionist l would make a point of leaving one for this stay so here you have it Oh whilst l m writing your internet is also about as good as your customer service skills 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Your website states that there is ample free parking on site However this is not true if you book through booking com and not them they have the audacity to charge you 5 per night to park They do not charge guests for parking if they book through them directly When I challenged this and told them they could not charge me as the booking com website says parking is free they reluctantly refunded me and said they would contact booking com and get it changed One month later and the website still says parking is free This hotel has really gone downhill The property is tired and dated and needs a complete overhaul The furniture needs updating and they need to inject some ambience and personality into the place It could be a fantastic property if someone with a flair for interior design got their hands on it 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel was more than an hour out of London It was very convenient if you wanted to travel out of London to the North or east but getting to the other side was a nightmare and if going to the city the train trip was more than an hour 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Receptionist was quite rood Room was mean t to be superior but was very basic and small We were only given one towel and it was a long walk down to the reception I ve stayed at nicer premier inns for less money 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rooms doors shower was old poor qulity and worn out which is not what you would expect looking at the pictures at Booking com It was also very hot inside A lot of noise outside and hot water in both water taps no cold water I would never expect poor qulity in a 4 star hotel 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I didn t like that my bed was on the wall next to the hallway so I can hear and feel doors closing and people walking My room was incredibly warm if you have the window close and fan off The light coming through my door from the hallway was really bright and had to use a pillow to hide the light The elevator was really old and felt unsafe using it 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Our bedroom looked and felt tired it does need a face lift especially the bathroom The plates for breakfast where ice cold This made the excellent breakfast cold very quickley Your staff are polite and nothing was to much trouble for them 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Hotel was very tired and desperately in need of some maintenance works Peeling paint worn carpets chipped furniture Beds brilliant size but headboards for much smaller ones which looked odd The Hallmark group should do the building and the staff a favour and revamp and refresh the whole place 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I was very disappointed with the bar which was so dis organised We attended a charity ball and stayed over The bar had no bottles of prosecco or champagne which seemed ridiculous as there was a hotel full and people willing to spend money as all dressed up attending an event The bar staff didn t know their drinks and ran out of glasses Also in some bars you couldn t use cards only cash I had registered as a coeliac for the meal I was offered no gluten free rolls had to ask twice to ensure my starter and mains were gluten free then I didn t get any pudding and after 5 times of asking they bought a bowl of chocolate ice cream which was awful I don t normally make a fuss but the tickets for this event were 100 each and the hotel should be able to cater for dietary requirements esp as they had prior warning 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The food was disappointing the evening meal choice was poor and the breakfast was cold tough and had been sitting around for a long time 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Shower could be better overhead only so wet hair and a strange range of vectors for the jets lol but hey it s a tiny drop of a negative in a sea of positive
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Very large delay in the kitchen for dinner Over an hour for a burger However I was issued a free drink and the staff were very apologetic
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No bedside light I had to move a standard lamp No kale in the Superfood Salad as advertised
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We had children running down the hall being loud slamming of foors early in the morning so didnt have a lot of sleep asked if we coyld check out a little later and got told no we also asked for ground floor but got put on 1st over the other side of the hotel
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room wasn t clean Bed had dust on it I m allergic to dust so was sneezing all night Bottom sheet in the bed had black marks on Bathroom only had one towel in it and there was two of us staying Hotel felt generally unclean especially for a 4 star and I wouldn t stay again
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Lack of attention to detail e g grubby curtains not hung properly in bedroom bathrooms needed a makeover paint flaking no bathmats taps lose too much light at night under the door only ONE chair to sit on and NO coffee table 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rooms needed a complete make over The way charges were made to your room was too complicated Buffet breakfast are ok if replenished often but not when food has been there ages and dried up 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, How we didn t find this hotel sooner 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rooms are really dirty dated and tatty the bedroom furniture is awful The bar was shut by 9pm on a Saturday night and there was no room service like advertised 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Didn t like lighting in the room it was very dark The bathroom really needs updating the decor was very poor paint peeling off etc for the price of the room I didn t get what I thought I had wasn t a splendid room at all very basic and there was an awful smell in the hallway 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Noisey guests running around shouting and banging doors after their wedding reception not informed by hotel that their was a function so had little sleep 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff looked half asleep when we arrived and the hotel is old looking Lifts smell really old room is old and dated 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bath room was very dirty it had black stains around the bath The window had black mold all around them The pictures show we would have a fridge but the receptionist said that non of the rooms have fridges 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Yes the bathroom was a little tired but all the facilities worked well The layout of the hotel took a little getting used to with the hotel making good use of a sloped site For rooms 200 take the lift from Reception to the first floor walk along some long corridors until you get to a second lift and again take the lift to the first floor yes first 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There wasn t a late night bar so when returning with friends who are also staying at hotel it s nice for the bar to open I was personally with 14 other people who had also booked rooms and we just wanted a late night drink 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff are very rude Issued the wrong from firstly I had requested a superior double room and was issued a small twin room I contacted reception who was rude they then moved me to a double room Which again was not a superior size as I had previously stayed at this hotel 3 weeks prior and was given a SUPERIOR room This stay was for two nights and the room was extremely smaller The staff response was we are fully booked Which was not the correct response I was looking for as this added to my doubt that I was in a smaller room then I had paid booked After being told by the receptionist we could use a specific door to exit into the gardens to smoke we was rudely told by another member of staff that we could not That the receptionist was wrong or she had not told us that we could use such door and we need to go to the front of the building Considering we are on the 3rd floor this is an extremely long walk 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, It was very dated The building itself is old I know but it needs up dating decor wise inside Reception area was dull and old fashioned pity as staff were great I also think it is way over priced Would definitely not say the hotel was 4 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Advertised Sky Channels along with room description non available Bed very hard Step up into Bathroom considered not safe I got up in the night to go to the toilet and walked off the edge falling onto the floor pulling my back Advise from Receptionist next morning have a warm shower 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The restaurant Service was slow at dinner we waited 50 minutes for our food and we only had main courses Drinks were an afternoon thought when ordering and took ages to arrive and it was the same story at breakfast had to ask twice for coffee and the buffet was sparce
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We have stayed here at this hotel before and the room was probably half the size of our previous room And the bed felt very small We were out all evening so it was fine for what we needed it for 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Bath room was so tiny and very old furniture and broken furniture you have to walk almost one mile from reception to your room 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Decor comfortable and clean but tired Unexpectedly had to pay for overnight parking as booked through Booking com rather than directly with hotel 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, In needs of some tlc bathrooms shower was broken needed more tea bags in the room only 2 for a over night stay think the breakfast could be included in the price
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There was a long distance to travel to the room there should be another entrance from rooms far away from the reception do Long distance for smokers to get outside No response from reception after 10pm took a long time to get hold of the night staff for room service 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No heating in room on arrival no heating at all in Bathroom Shower in need of update Rip off 5 Car Park charge for Booking com Customers only
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Single beds pushed together Waiting over an hour for food and the restaurant wasn t busy then hair in burger 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No food No double bed Staff not helpful st reception
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Rooms smaller than expected from pictures And wasn t quite as clean some leftover food under the desk that hadn t been cleaned away Staff weren t great noisy radiator in the room that impacted sleep reception didn t answer when we called them multiple times and the fire alarm went off at midnight along with some very noisy people in the room next door after the event they were hosting at the hotel

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, More tea coffee and milk available in rooms We had to ask for more milk No one seemed to know where extra cartons were but we did get a little jug of fresh milk which was great 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We were only staying at the hotel for one night and arrived late afternoon on a Saturday The customer service was poor on arrival and it felt very unprofessional It was at this point we ordered a breakfast for the next morning and also paid our bill The corridors leading to the bedrooms smelt terrible similar to swimming pool toilets The bedroom which was a superior double was the most basic room we have stayed in and we have absolutely no idea why it was rated superior The complimentary shampoo and conditioner had been used and one had very little left in it The room was small and far too hot The shower was luke warm No mirror anywhere near the dressing table and the lighting was incredibly poor Before our evening out we went to the bar for a drink and something light to eat We ordered at 6pm when the bar opened for food and our club sandwich arrived 45 minutes later Poor service Unfortunately due to one of us being unwell we had to check out early which was late Saturday night We asked if it was possible to have the 16 we paid for breakfast 6 5 hours earlier refunded to which we were told No once it s booked it s booked We found this very odd as it s not as if the chef had started cooking We will definitely not be returning or recommending this hotel Very disappointing

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, First room smelt of smoke which was changed for a room that smelt of mould obvious damp issue in the room Also corridor smelt of someone smoking cannabis When mentioned to the receptionist on checking out she didn t seem that perturbed The overall appearance of the corridors to the bedrooms is tardy and dated Note this hotel is in a built up area not as the site photos would suggest

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The heating in the bathroom was out of order They fixed the plug with tapes but not working To print an invoice for the stay did take 8 min because the receptionist could not make it In addition it was not a VAT invoice which I discovered the next day It was not very clean Breakfast only until 9 30 Ridiculous I prepaid but I did not take it 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Voices and doors easily heard in corridor at night but not much you can do about that it is a hotel

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, This hotel is VERY tired The rooms are extremely old and tatty Cheap fixtures and fittings that haven t been maintained or updated Bath was falling apart and there is no double glazing I wouldn t of minded too much except the price tag that comes with this at 130 a night For this price stick to premier inn travelogde

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The restaurant Basically it was as if the hotel becomes overstretched when trying to manage functions and a restaurant Friday 14th oct saw us eating very late having booked for 8pm My rib main course was tough and inedible and the second attempt not much better The lamb course had run out but we were not advised until we had placed the orders and there seemed to be confusion over the orders in general Not inspiring for the groom who was entertaining his parents from jersey and his about to be in laws

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The noise from staff ALL morning and afternoon outside of my room room 102 was loud and frustrating as I just wanted to relax and sleep but couldn t because all I heard was the conversations and doors opening and closing Selection of TV channels was limited I asked for Sausages Baked Beans and Hash browns for breakfast and I got given Bacon instead of Hash Browns I was too hungry to have to request to swap for the right items I wanted to use the iron however after I had put water in it it began to leak so therefore I opted against it which left me looking scruffy as I couldn t iron my outfit as intended On our second night the bar staff made myself and my partner uncomfortable as I was told upon arrival at the hotel that my stay included a meal allowance but I could potentially use it towards drinks in the bar but mainly because I got there when dinner had finished as we had plans to have dinner at another venue on our 2nd night I thought that perhaps we may be able to use the allowance towards drinks instead However the lady behind the bar was very confused The query was resolved and we ended up just paying for our drinks I have to use a straw and there were only 5 available to use It sounds like a minor issue but as there was only 4 people in the bar area and 2 members of on duty bar staff you d think the small details would be manageable Also herself a chap also working behind the bar and another staff member who I think was off duty were chatting among themselves which was very awkward as customer service wasn t a priority Overall after paying 267 for 2 nights upon arrival at the hotel I just can t say it was worth such an amount 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I almost did not use your hotel as due to my travelling during the day I tried calling the hotel to book a room directly and was told the hotel was fully booked I then pulled into the next available services and went on Booking com and looked for a hotel in the area and guess what the hotel had a number of rooms available As I have used this chain before and my meeting the next day was close by I booked it but I was not happy but decided to talk to the reception about what had happened By booking through bookings com website the room ended up costing me more than advertised on your website I mentioned to the receptionist at the hotel and discovered she was the one who had taken my call She stated since calling a room had become available which was a lie as the hotel was no where near full which I had confirmed by the house keeping staff who were very helpful There was no apology from her no offer of a discount for the extra cost in fact nothing not even someone to take my case to my room Due to this lie unfortunately although I have regularly stayed in your hotels before as I travel around the UK and do find the standard of your hotels to be very good I will not be staying again Having discovered the hotel was not full I can only assume you earn more for customers to book through other websites and so do not wish customers to book directly either that or your staff do not want customers and are happy for customers to pay more Either way not great As a CEO of a company if my staff acted this way I would not be happy 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Had to wait 45 minutes for Manager to get back on site to open our safe so we could leave Thought 140 was very expensive hotel is quite dated and tatty have stayed in much better hotel s that have been cheaper and much better value for money and breakfast wasn t even included in the price

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bathroom was a little tired with an unpleasant smell of damp and could benefit from a refit A surprise was the recent addition of a 5 overnight parking charge which was waived when I stated that free overnight parking was stated on the booking form however it would make me think twice about returning for more than a one night stay 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Pokey little single room more like a cupboard than a bedroom with a a very poor single bed My colleague paid the same price and had an adequate double room For just under 100 I would expect something better Tried to change room but was fobbed off saying that the hotel was full Breakfast was very poor so all in all not much going for it Have stayed this year in over couple of dozen hotels but this one is easily bottom of the list particularly as I booked it 6weeks in advance my colleague booked 1day in advance 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Room was much smaller than pictured staff was rude when I asked about it No AC And I had 2 very large spiders in my room The night manager gave out my room number and let a person come to my room without my knowledge at 1am Could of been a murderer also the guy wasn t asked any kind of ID and was just pointed to my room Very very unprofessional and unsafe 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There were no designated car parking spaces for the hotel guests so I was ask to park on the road and move the car at a later stage which was very inconvenient I was woken by the night staff at 1 15 am and asked to move my car even though nobody had complained as I was eventually in a car parking space The reason for this was that the night receptionist felt my car might be damaged by hotel staff as it was in a space near an exit that was being used to clear a room They thought it would be much better to wake a paying guest than keep an eye on the people they had either let in or employ They also had no idea why I would be upset about this as they thought they were doing me a favour unbelievable Also booking through Booking com I was led to believe that I was booking a room that would normally demand a rate of 200 per night and that I was lucky enough to get a discounted rate of 96 There is no way that room should be 200 per night ever I have tried phoning the hotel to talk to the manager but the line is always busy

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The restaurant launched a new menu the night I stayed and the kitchen didn t have half the meals they didn t even have soup or pate I m a veggie so had a choice of one thing that came undercooked despite us waiting over an hour for the food i refused to pay for the meal or the wine consumed I realise the hotel is being re vamped and it really needs it as its a pretty tired place Looks like it needs a vacuum in places
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Standard room wasn t what was advertised on the website being given another room to walk in on a naked man As you can appreciate neither of us were impressed I couldn t get out of the room fast enough The staff finding this funny when i told them no hairdryer in the room I couldn t get a hot shower as the water was lukewarm quite a distance to walk from the rooms to the bar new menu was implemented on the day I arrived however they hardly had any of the dishes they were advertising It got to the point when i asked the waitress to advise what they actually had to offer which wasn t much as this would be easier than me asking for things to be told they didn t have it I work away quite often and stay in hotels on a regular basis however I will not be returning to this particular hotel

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The wifi was very poor also the check out time should be at 12 like most hotels because if you come to your room late from a party like we did with a 2 year old we couldn t have a lay in til 12 and felt we was rushed off our feet including my poor son who s only turned 2 that was still tired

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Disappointed with public toilet facilities lady s toilet is downstairs Disabled toilets in separate building 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, room not clean enough noisy plumbing breakfast staff very surely Tiny telly whole place in need of redecoration and new carpets 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bedrooms bathrooms could do with a refurbish they look quite dated and the shower was quite uneffective bed not the most comfortable 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Wifi kept dropping out Not easy to get to by public transport 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The signage to some of the bedrooms could be better placed as some can only be reached after a lengthy walk down a long annex corridor when poor signage means rooms were easily missed as the use of the lift was required at this point Another set of guests I bumped into wished me luck finding my room 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff were really young and lack experience in customer service rooms long way away from reception and very tired and dated needs revamp Poor communication was charged for things I had but morning reception was not aware of prepayment
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Due to the functions going on at the hotel parking was rather manic but having got a space we left the car where it was and used public transport The nearest tube station is a good 20 minute walk and taxis not cheap 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We booked 2 superior rooms and one double There were 4 adults and 3 teenagers Upon arrival we were told that the rooms were not made up for families and had to wait whilst they put extra beds in 2 of the rooms One room was large enough for this but the other was a standard double and the additional bed made it rather cramped We were informed that this always happens with bookings made on Booking com
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff unhelpful hotel more interested in the functions going on than people staying there No guarantee of a parking space as informed by staff it was on a first come first served basis even though requested on site parking on booking Booked superior room but sure was given ordinary double room where paint peeling off bathroom ceiling toilet bowl cracked and carpet stained Checked out a day early for these reasons and received no apology or regret from staff
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No 24hr room service breakfast terrible everything swimming with grease no normal toast horrible saturated fried bread fatty bacon snotty eggs almost in edible and certainly not worth the money we tried to order the 24hr room service at about 2am and were told we couldn t have anything not even a sandwich I m afraid to say that this was false advertising and we booked so we could use this facility which was not available we did order room service for lunch which took an hour and a half for these reasons I wouldn t stay again 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There was no hot water in our wing of the hotel which also meant there was no heating The room was also very dated and worn There was a blue bottle in the room as well 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No heating in room very cold Water not very warm either Room in need of modernisation but set against price it was value for money for a London hotel in Chigwell
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Unfortunately it was freezing cold in the restaurant We did ask for radiators to be put on and a portable heater was also brought to us Regrettably some of the evening staff serving dinner were not very experienced and one in particular was actually quite rude I just got told to bring it out when we asked for custard rather than ice cream with an apple pie which we ordered Ice cream was the last thing we wanted when we were still defrosting We understand mistakes are made but it was the attitude to the request more than anything else It was also cold on ground floor and another room twin 105 was cold no radiators working 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Public lounge a bit tired Understaffed at breakfast two ladies serving were doing their best it was very busy Had to ask for table to be laid then after 10 mins still waiting for tea coffee then cups and saucers were missing 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The internet connection was extremely poor They allowed pets but would not allow the pet to be left in the room alone so you couldn t leave to eat at a restaurant or leave to eat even in the hotel as restaurants don t allow pets The bathroom taps didn t always work The power in the room kept turning off and we had to call reception to reset it every few hours When we complained they treated us like idiots Then after tried offering to book us into another hotel which we packed for and then they said they forgot about the request Horrible experience 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel is not located at 13 minutes walk from Blackhorse Underground station Doesn t have 4 stars The stairs stinks Horrible staff I vd asked for a cappucino and I was told that they are too busy for that at 7 30 am with 2 other table in the restaurant Non professional staff at all The walls at the room fave mould and I think they belong to an old church 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Dirty rooms in fact for Hallmark disgusting The service was shocking and as for breakfast nothing was filled up cutlery crockery filthy 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel in general was very tired and in much need of major decoration and carpeting Disapointed with breakfast options and the tables were cleared but not wiped between sittings Plates where not always clean when put out to use Toilet bowl was cracked reported Issues with door cards when returning after a long day in London only to find that the card had wiped clean and had to do the long walk back to reception to have it reset this happened every time we left the hotel One of the lifts had alinement issues and would drop an inch or so as you got in reported Hotel reception is like a tradesmans entrance not a good location 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent,No Negative
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent,No Negative
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Cleanliness wasn t the best and the night porters didn t do a very good job of removing other people s room service trays from the corridors which wasn t very nice to see first thing on a morning As a night supervisor in a 4 hotel myself I know what is expected of me The room wasn t ready for us when we arrived as I believe there was some mix up with our booking which wasn t the hotels fault but the reception staff sorted this out quite promptly for us which we thank you for The walk to the bedroom was a long one and the decor was very dated and shabby There was not a very fresh smell in the corridors which you might want housekeeping to take a look at Dusty would be the word I would use We wouldn t use you again but you did serve a purpose and didn t cause us too much problem Sorry for the rant Yours sincerely Dean McKechnie
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Key cards didn t work so had to go all the way back down to reception to get them sorted out The lift is very strange We were in room 216 so most normal hotels would have a lift to go to 2nd floor not this one To get to 216 from ground floor reception you have to take one lift to 1 then walk round to second lift and press 1 again to get to 216 so you can imagine when I got to my room and the key cards both didn t work I was fed up as it takes the most stupid of routes to get there in the first place If you can take the stairs much easier but not ideal if you have heavy luggage Also it would be nice when reception check you in to know what they are talking about We were told breakfast is extra and we had our booking with us to say breakfast included It also shouldn t take two staff to serve one couple we were left waiting when one of the staff could have helped us not a great first impression 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We booked as a couple for the night of our wedding when we got in we found 3 single beds all divided with a chest of draws The shower basin were cracked and looked very dirty too Will not return 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Tea coffe etc supplied but no milk which was pressumably an oversite 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We ordered food in the bar one meal was not cooked properly The staff returned the food to the kitchen and it was never seen again The staff apologised and didn t charge us for the meal and then provided some sandwiches free of charge Next morning at breakfast we ordered eggs these never came 
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room had no milk with our team and coffee only 2 of the electric plugs worked the bathroom radiator was repaired with black tape cracked and broken tiles around bath and shower bath panel was well past it s use date as paint peeling off Thought I had booked into some sort of hostel very disappointed

Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room was dated and needed decorating not very clean not as nice as it looks in the pictures
Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The wifi wasn t strong enough in our room I ended up having to use my phone wifi hotspot to use my iPad The decor in the corridors was quite outdated and worn out if this had a bit of a refurb or even a repaint and a fresh carpet it would have been perfect Also the lifts are quite creaky and could use a little servicing I was quite scared it would breakdown with us inside so I used the stairs for the rest of my stay

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Nevertheless location is far from perfect Despite on the map you see it as near Tangenziale it does not have straight way to it so you have to drive away 5 7 minutes before you get to any civilization The hotel itself is surrounded by dull industrial zone The parking is 8 euro per night but being located that far you expect the parking to be included in the price or free of charge The rooms need renovation We were a family of 7 people in 2 rooms and in both we experienced broken doors in douche not working lamps etc We also had broken lamellae of the additional sofa bed fixed by myself There is no kettle and tea coffee in the room and mini bar was extremely poor just two bottles of 0 5 water Breakfast is weak there was just scrambled and boiled eggs few types of sausage and very rare salad with no separate vegetables The next day of our stay the hotel was so crowded that one had to wait for even plates and cups for 15 20 minutes the same about main dishes That is really not what you expect from 4 hotel

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Hard to reach after 9 30 PM by public transport 76 With Bus no 80 we can reach it till 1AM but it is 1 2 KM away Double Bed in the standard room is not good it is bit hard No paper pen provided in the room to write some notes to the hotel

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, On the site it s advertised there s free shuttle service to Milan But when we went we were told this wasn t available Which was a big reason why we chose this hotel Moreover the restaurant isn t all that great Food selection is small and the waiters even forgot to get our food for us So we waited over 2 hours for food The pizza I ordered was very soggy Definitely not a 4 star restaurant

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Dog started to bark outside at 6 30 am Walls are too thin and housekeeping makes noise starting from 7am Impossible to have a quality sleep Blanket was not wrapped with duvet cover and appeared dirty 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, One factor that I didn t like was the fact that the hotel was far from the city and bus stop near the hotel was available till 21 30 a little bit early 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Unfortunately the setting bed was defective It looked in such a way as if the repairs in the rooms bath bed were implemented unprofessionally 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Rooms was dirty there was a lot of bugs Also i take some photo of room bugs Last day cleaner didn t left shower gel shower and soup Also didn t change towels Every day was the same food 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room smelt like there was a dead rat inside we tried figuring out what it was we couldnt we thought it was the carpet which was smelling but we weren t sure the smell yaaak the hotel is a distance from Sansiro metro station though I can get a bus from there which takes 20 mins before it departs

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, When we were looking somewhere to book quickly as we were stuck in Milan with a flat tyre we looked this up and it looked nice from the photos When we turned up the surroundings were not what we expected as it was tucked away in the middle of no where and not in a good way We checked in with no problems though other guests seemed to have problems this should have been a warning we got to our room and it looked very basic but the first big problem was when I went to the bathroom and I then got stuck With much force I got the door open but i didn t try it again That was when I started to look properly the phone was unplugged and had no numbers or buttons there was no pictures on the walls just holes and screws to where there used to be a picture The menus or any useful information was missing and the door off the shower was falling off never mind the bugs that kept flying in My partner went down to request another room to which they apologised and gave us another room My partner checked the other room and because of the shape of the room it was only half the size When something is wrong with your first room I didn t appreciate a smaller room We went down again and they gave us another room this room now had a window that wouldn t shut and not wanting to repeat the incident of bugs flying in we went down again They then sent someone up to fix that window All whilst this was happening I had to stay in the original room as we had two dogs with us and found it unfair to take them room to room with all of our luggage and this original room no had no electricity as they had deactivated the key and room Nothing was compensated and there wasn t really an apology to the fact that we had to change rooms three times All rooms seemed to be different or have something missing so I was extremely disappointed and will be writing a email of complaint to the hotel directly 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, I arrived there after a long way and was very tired i was very happy to get into my room but the room was very hot and air consitioner did not work there was no toalet paper in the bathroom and telefon did not work so i could not reach out the receptionist The girl at the reception was quite rude she told me that it was actually my fault that i could not start the airconditioner I asked to change the room i got new key but the lock did not work The staff did not appologize at all I dont know if its lack of english or just an italian way to treat customers i will not stay at this hotel again for sure

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Safe wouldn t open Shower door fell off Shower flooded Shower head kept falling off Shuttle that was suppose to take us to the train station was missing 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Payment of parking still I can t figure it out why since there is no other option and is their own parking Far from city centre compensated with a reasonable price 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, We received a very good deal on this hotel so it makes it difficult to criticize but here are few points Despite the hotel looked very modern taps in bathrooms in two different rooms were very loose making it difficult to get warm water in one one of the rooms The position of the hotel wrt the centre of Milan is far from ideal The frequency of the public transport from the last metro station tram station at the Stadium of San Siro to the hotel is not very high The advertised shuttle was not operating during our stay It takes about an hour to get from the hotel to the center and you need to make sure not miss your bus 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, it s a not easy to find hotel The hotel is in an industrial area and we were going around and around for hours and we couldn t find it even with GPS You have to put the address via Enrico Fermi to find the hotel The hotel has a lot of parking area but you have to pay extra for it instead of being free 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room was dirty and the sealing was repaired and not finished the smell was awfull and yeah it s a 2 star hotel so think twice before you book here I don t recomend 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, additional cost wifi additional cost parking far away location not so clean not worth saving few euros its better to spend this extra money not on parking or wifi but for better hotel 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It s not in San Siro It s much farer
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast and dinner foods is not good The garden needed maitance Not enough chairs in the lobby bar Toilet for men are very bad en maitance needed This hotel is not 4 stars 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Poor breakfast same every day The location is not so bad but the bus to metro is too hard to get 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, One of the worst hotel I have ever seen No cattle iron hairdryer is not working I requesting some ice to make Compresses to my child they answered no we don t have I requested a cattle to prepare some tea they answered rudely not available The breakfast is so poor bread and cakes The location is out of nowhere in the middle of industrial zone far from the center with 30 minutes with the car The staff need a lot of training how to deal with the guests they seems to be not caring if you are satisfied or not The room is full of mosquitos and flies Parking costs you 8 euro per night and you have to check the kiosk every time you come out the parking I strongly not recommending this hotel for any one 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Location quite far from the city and even San Ciro need a car WiFi not very good and sign up is social network e mail bound If we are to pay for parking we should at least get some covered places Breakfast lacked variety and healthy options
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The worst hotel that I have ever stayed My hand bag stole at the hotel s restaurant while I was making breakfast When we wanted to look at the security camera records they said us that they don t have camera Can you imagine that a hotel does not have any camera What a fool situation Also the stuff took it normally as it happens every time Besides its location is very far away from the center Briefly if you don t want to perish with your money do not approach Idea Hotel Exactly 0 points 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Do not like the breakfast arrangement very disorganised 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast is given as 7 10 30 and the most annoying thing was being told as we were eating breakfast finished rather rudely with no pre warning at about 10 35 10 40 and finding out the coffee machine etc all turned off and staff standing over us trying to get us to leave My rather slow eater 3 year old was pretty put out she couldn t finish all her co co pops Was also pretty annoying at the breakfast as we got there about 9 45 and the croissants ran out just as we got there and there wasn t much bread left either Strange as loads of cake cheese salami etc that no one was really eating but hardly any bread croissants Why not swop 4 cakes for a few more croissants Lack of proper coffee and proper juice The lay out of breakfast also quite strange and frustrating eg milk miles away from the cereal and spoons miles away from them Only had 3 pillows and 2 towels for 4 of us A little bit tired looking round the edges but fine for the price 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, I choose this hotel only because before booking I read that they have FREE shuttle to airport After booking there was written that shuttle is for additional cost When I arrived to hotel I found out that shuttle buss starts only from 09 00 so beware that this hotel thinks that peoples don t fly in the mornings Taxi from hotel to airport we found out from reception that it costs 140 euros And to get from hotel to airport in the morning it s huge problem because you need choose multiple metros trains buses My advice for everyone who travels without car choose hotel which is in center because there from central station you can find shuttle for normal money Also in hotel room there was very weird unpleasant smell Left window open all night and still it didn t came out 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Not good breakfast horrible Coffee Drink was served in plastic cup You must pay 10 2 per extra for city tax and 8 for 24h parking 30 minutes to city center by car 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is nice and comfortable although is a bit far from metrostation That I did not like is when I check out the wifi network was fail and I had to wait a 40 minutes for noting i was delate for my flight and after that the reception took my credit card details to pay a tourist tax otherwise I have paid for overnight stays 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Wifi is based on Facebook and Google sponsorship Breakfast is quite basic and very based on a sugar based menu cakes white bread choko pops rather than dark bread cereals fruit etc

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It looked like two star hotel AT MOST Dirty walls Stains on bed frame organic origin bleh There was naked man in my room when checked in When spoken with staff they seem not care too much about such a terrible mistake Didn t offered anything as apology just a short sorry They ve checked me in to a occupied room Wanted to ask for refund but I had not enough time and was too tired to deal with the situation Over all terrible experience 3 10
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast was poor Bad instant coffee bad juices bacon not cooked well and on the second day no bacon at all no sausages Location without a car is too far away 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The name San Siro suggests a location near the stadium and metro station This is not the case It s possible to travel to Milan by bus but the latest bus returns around nine at night 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Not 4 stars No tea coffee facilities A plastic cup in double room one towel in double room Staff not sure of approximate cost of taxes No complementary mineral water Terrace looks on to unkempt grounds and parking was charged for No porter facilities after 22 00 4 stars no way

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, A few minor breakages in the room that we had to report and could not work out how to work air com But all in all it was fine 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Do no enter in that kitchen Disgusting food Just everything left on the plate even water If you expect 1 star hotel you are in the right place Room looks clean but not really confident I would kindly recommend not to come to this hotel 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Don t recommend this hotel to anyone on the night we arrived we had dinner in the hotel and the food and service was awful On the last night the hotel had a problem with electric power and we stayed 4 hours without electricity we couldn t even get to our rooms 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Area around the hotel is full of mess rubbishy Hotel staff are not able to book shuttle bus to metro we booked bus from hotel to San Siro metro bus never arrived Transport to hotel and from hotel doesn t exist Also we got only one key from room we were told no ore keys When we checked in they scanned our Europe passports and it is against EU directive regarding invasion of privacy Very backward hotel Never there again

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro,No Negative
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is located in nowhere not close to any metro station and every taxi to the city costs about 20 25 The price was very high but we stayed during the UCL final The is nothing to do in the hotel itself so it s just a clean place to stay in 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, There is a 8 euro per 24 hr parking fee and a 10 euro city tax so if you are on a tight budget you may want to take this on board but I personally like the secure parking

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is a little far away from central Milan although this is fine if you get the metro and the bus from just outside that takes you to the hotel The restaurant staff were not the most friendly 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The room no hot water in the shower loud AirCond empty mini bar non working fridge Breakfast choice was very poor The hotel is right next to a highway which is pretty loud too Can t recommend

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, difficult to reach with public transport only one bus line The hotel looks worn out and run down Food in the local restaurant was really bad and expensive Breakfast was not included and WIFI cost 9 EUR for a day which works only for one device and sometimes the access code gets invalid and you have to ask the Reception for a new one All in all one of the worst hotels i have stayed in I can t fathom how they can have more than 2 stars 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, They have a heating problem Rooms are between 26 and 29 degrees Celsius and can t get cooler After 2 room changes they finally gave us a room at ground floor There with the window wide open outside minus 1 it was able to stay and sleep Places like this should be closed by the government They ruin the environment with a non functioning heating system We will never go there again

Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms were in great need of re fit tatty breakfast was ok nothing special one member of staff picked a knife up that had fallen to the floor and reused it when resetting another table 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Price per night simply reflects the area n at Park Lane Would not pay that tariff for tired and dated facilities anywhere else Unable to open window as screwed shut and mobile air con unit made the room even hotter as the motor was running so long 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs to be upgraded I had a single room which was good value for money but it was just that a single bed and very small room not often found in hotels these days 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not accessible so don t book here if you re in a wheelchair because there are 3 steps to get to the lifts 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Place in general is very tired Beds are not comfy or luxurious but sheets are very clean Bathroom is really outdated and in very poor condition 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The location of this hotel is at the rear of the Hilton at Park Lane Directly opposite is their loading bay Constant noise of recycling of glass bottles and heavy goods vehicles Entry and exit point for staff End of shift staff from the Hilton blaring radios on scooters and shouting loudly to each on breaks 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, everything 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, no room boy to take your bags while check in and out 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very dated decor and new bathroom needed Curtains didn t fit window frame by 5inches so sunlight shone through great if you wanted to get up at 5am 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The property is badly run down and needing attention badly marked walls and doors dirty appliances and I wouldn t take my socks off on that carpet The lifts stopped working The hot water was unreliable on the first night Very surprised at the state of the hotel given the price 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I was asked if I wanted breakfast the following day when checking in but decided in the morning that we did not want any so I called at 9am to cancel however was told that because I booked it at check in at a promotional price I was not aware of this I was not entitled to a refund Quite disappointed this was not explained at the time 32 down the drain 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Facilities were antiquated The room was small carpet was old wallpaper torn smudged and in extreme disrepair Air conditioning was noisy at all times Breakfast was marginal For these reasons would not book a stay there again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, See above 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Windows in the room were difficult to open and air conditioning was noisy Not sure we would feel that we got value for money if we had had to pay the full listed hotel price 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, If you are after a gym and pool or a fancy restaurant in the hotel then this ain t the hotel for you but if like us your weekend is already packed then this makes a great base 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was small and noisy the air con sounded like a tractor and the noise from outside was constant all night If you want a good night sleep don t stay here We had an executive room so for the extra cost you get a dressing gown which we didn t use 2 bottles of water which are not replaced for the second night and some shower gels the room is small and has no drawers for clothes we won t be returning
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast wasn t hot and tea and coffee very poor And don t ask reception to book a taxi Went to Marble Arch fixed price of 17 00 black cab back cost 4 80 from the same location Taxi rank just outside the Hilton 1 minute away
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bed The TV Having to pay separately for the breakfast
Park Lane Mews Hotel, furnishings decoration and bathroom 40 years old literaly Unproffessional staff though front desk pleasant Not a Quality price match 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It would seem original air conditioning unit not working any more Ones in the room very noisy and not terribly effective 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Front desk staff were not very knowledgeable room keys did not work on 4 occasions and had to be replaced bar was not very good eg put a slice of lemon in my scotch I would not go back
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Maybe it s just western culture but I found the beds to be a bit uncomfortable but nothing that really took away from the overall experience 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The dirtiness the staff the cost everything was to the detriment of the guest Apalling
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dirty bathroom old facilities worn furniture torn and dirty curtains Furniture all shabby doors and all wooden elements cracked scratched carpet dirty with stains one doesn t want to take off shoes mir even sit on the chairs lamps hang out of shape air conditioning placed in like in a shanty shelter huge hose hanging out of the only window cracks and holes plus writings on the shabby wallpaper lamp have cracked covers the rentokil box rats under the receptionists trolley also didn t make me feel very cosy I can provide photos of all this over all s shabby highly over priced location I m happy I have not chosen by myself but was offered as a compensation for the most scandalous accomodation I booked with booking previously stunning Bond Street apartment in south molton street which has been cancelled by the owner Carol with me shortly before my arrival and only upon MY calling the accommodation to ask something on luggage drop this was the biggest scandal I ever experienced with booking so after hours of negotiation with the former landlord and booking I was finally helped out with this park lane mews hotel as a compensation accommodation which I am luckily not paying off fully still waiting for booking to contact me plus refund me 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy neighbour I eventually complained to reception at 1 30 when the visitor was asked to turn his television down He did but at 7 he had it back on again full pelt I had asked for a quiet room but I was right by the lift So not a good night s sleep 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, renovating the lifts and rooms 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It is not a four star hotel The picture are not compelling to the reality The corridor are scary dark and ruined The room are small and old The materas is old and uncomfortable Internet wasn t working properly We have had to leave and they not even reimburse for the night we have not used It is should be advertised as a three stars hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The condition of the hotel fell far far below four star class and I m amazed they ve retained this rating if they have The corridors were tired with door frames marked by years of trollies banging into them The room was blessed with a noisy antiquated air conditioner dirty wall a carpet with scorch marks from an iron and a small double with an old mattress Not worth the money even in such a good location 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was incredibly warm and the air conditioning wasn t working Thankfully we were able to transfer to another room and that was better The place could do with a lick of paint it is tired worn and a bit grubby Rooms are tiny with incredibly small wardrobes 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioner didn t work well Last day there were no hand towels in the bathroom There was an additional bath mat hung up where the hand towel should be 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noise from aircon in the room that didn t even work Rang staff and asked for a fan at least as boiling room yet they never sent the fan nor rang to apologise for lack of one Not even a bottle of water in the room Will not recommend or stay there again
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel lobby is reasonably clean and well maintained but the hotel corridors look shabby and the rooms a bit tired The carpet in our room was not in good condition The bed was very uncomfortable as were the pillows The curtain was so thin it let in all the light with sunrise at 4 40 am this meant a very early wake up A renovation of the hotel interiors is overdue 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Poor WIFI not for business use Old furniture time for a refresh I would never pay the full price at this hotel the beds are old and uncomfortable room equipment need a refresh airco not working 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was very small only one pretty uncomfortable chair sticky surfaces therefore not as clean as it should be noisy air conditioning Check in staff distracted by someone else half way through the process 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Restaurant staff bit grumpy Reception staff very good Rooms bit small but overall not bad value considering location 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is in need of an over haul We knew not to expect too much from this hotel having read previous reviews and chose this hotel based on price and location IF you can over look the following you can manage to stay here Windows required two of us to try and open We managed 2 space for fresh air Curtain will open with some difficulty Toilet often times required 4 5 flushes to work we mentioned this to staff and it didn t come as a surprise We did require help turning on TV as they are set up strangely and require you push numbers into remote to work staff kindly came to room to help but could have easily been avoided with instructions for guests Woodwork is damaged throughout the hotel The bed was soft for my liking We had just come from 3 differing places in Paris where the beds were very comfortable This may be a matter of taste Seemed to be dust dirt build up around the edges of room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Executive room was tiny air con had a fault and was uncontrollable although did produce cool air when on room was directly about the smoking area unofficial so was prone to unpleasant odours street view only
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Original room booked was small and stuffy with one window that could not be fully opened and no working air conditioner or fan 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Because we stayed 2 nights would of liked a top up on tea and coffee facilites but not a major issue as plenty of cafes bars close to the complex
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It wasn t as clean as I would have expected the furniture is tired and the sofa covers need cleaning the d cor could do with some updating a little grubby in places the phones were really outdated and somewhat worse for wear the window didn t open and on a really hot day it is must as the air conditioning was not really cold 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was not climate controlled and London was warm We were very glad that fans were available upon request at the desk Both room and lobby were due for redecorating but clean and comfortable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were dated and like a sweat box we did request a plug in fan and were supplied with a desk top one which did help the rooms and hotel in general were very dated I asked for ice with my drink and was told the ice machine was not working so I was only able to have one small piece my water was warm
Park Lane Mews Hotel, This could be a bijou with refurbishment Decor rather tired and worn did not match expectations from the external photos of hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the air conditioning was not really working well we asked the front desk to send someone to fix it because other than turning it on or off there was nothing we could do not temperature control nor hi low of the fan the response we got was because the building was old there is nothing the hotel can do to fix the problem 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air Con was broken but not advised on Check In had to ring once got into the room and then waited over 90 mins for someone to deliver then fit the portable one Breakfast was not great food had dried out as it was just sitting in the warmers
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were harassed poorly trained and grumpy with only one notable exception I asked for a strong coffee in the morning this was refused twice and when I asked again if it may be possible to have a stronger coffee the coffee served was the colour of weak tea the waitress brought me a sachet of nescafe and told me I could tip it into the cup The evening receptionist was too busy slamming down telephones and was extremely harassed and angry when I arrived The morning receptionist made up for it by being very understanding and arranging for a refund for my breakfast 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are a tiny and a bit tired Headboard had big stain on it But otherwise generally passable Wifi was poor 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, not customer oriented Very bad service Ordered some room service the bar called me later on to say that my card wasn t pre authorized and therefore I had to prepare some cash Upon explaining that no one asked me to pre authorize my card and that I didn t have any cash left they replied that I should come down to pay with my card and hang up on me I needed a pair of scissors but no one at reception or at the bar would have one to lend I emailed to enquire whether I could check in earlier but no one ever reply back 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The whole hotel needs a serious update For the location and usual price I was expecting a better looking hotel Not worth paying for it Travelodge is better 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, We were fortunate to get a table in the restaurant for breakfast they are not geared up well for breakfast 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy bathroom air filter air conditioning not very good Room very small and not much of a selection of teas in the room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Shower was broken and the receptionist told me it was probably because I did not understand how to use it TV remote and TV were struggling etc probably ok 15 years ago 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Arrived late in the evening and left in the morning so didn t have time to find any dislikes 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Price arranged through Booking com colleague booked same stay nights through travel agent same room type etc cost 50 of your price RIP OFF 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The light switches in the room were dirty the window did not shut properly and the position of our room on the front of the building meant we heard every single bin being emptied at the crack of dawn and even earlier some late night revellers in no mood for sleep had awful nights sleep
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Nothing you get what you pay for 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Service in the restaurant was very slow and they weren t replacing the food as soon as it ran out The shower in our room was just a trickle of water Property very run down 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bedroom was extremely cramped The breakfast muesli which is supposed to be healthy was very sweet and sugary 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, My room was facing onto the back lane and it was very noisy Woken up at 2 45am thinking it was road works but the hotels towels were being collected and the guy moving the crates was making the biggest racket in the middle of the night Then around 6 30am it was the big wheely bins turn to be emptied Not the quietest of rooms
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms are dated and in desperate need of refurbishing our room was very hot and window could not be opened as it had been screwed shut 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very expensive for what it was it was a small basic room and limited space Paying 160 for a small bed and a small toilet was a little disappointing 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Did not enjoy anything Has this place been cleaned or renevated since 1800 its 2017 clean would be nice Could not open Windows 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Whole hotel in serious need of refurbishment Bed particularly uncomfortable All the furniture very knocked about 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel corridors are in need of tlc
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were old but clean an update is definitely in order The location was excellent close to so many key locations and beautiful parks 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only thing I would comment on was that the bath was not terribly easy to get out of A larger person than me would probably still be there There are handles on the side but it IS a compact bath might be safer to use the shower 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only criticism is that the facility could use a remodel
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is so old The paints are fading wall papers cracked furniture looks like 30 years old and the toilet doors could barely be closed 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It was a well worn hotel with little to offer other than its position which is excellent The staff were friendly but the whole hotel is well below the standards set by the big chains such as travel lodge let alone any Mayfair top grade hotels I couldn t recommend it to anyone I know 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was far too small even tho o was moved to a larger room I still had to dismantle my wheelchair so I could move around the room The whole hotel needs doing up as it s falling apart The lift is tiiny and accessibility is not very good for disabled travellers 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bedrooms are a little dated in their decor but we didn t go to London to stay in a room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was priced ok for London but hotel is very dated and could do with some modernisation 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room we were given initially was not good enough as decor was not ok 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small considering we were told on check in we had been upgraded I m not sure what size the room would have been before an upgrade Although we were upgraded to executive double there was only facilities for one guest 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything The breakfast was of low quality The bed I slept on was so thin that I could feel the spring under The AC was at least 30 years old and was blowing unfiltered air very dusty The hotel shows its age and the staff are clearly in for the dough 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Overall this hotel is in need of refurbishment Our 4th floor room was rather dingy and relied on 2 oil filled radiators for heating 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms in need of refurbishment The carpet was terrible and woodwork peeling No room for the case and had to sleep with this on the bed I am 65 I could not have goy into the batch shower
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Every day the same breakfast with small variety of food Tinny rooms with no safe Comparing with other hotels in London where we stayed before its realy overpriced 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very dated and in need of some serious updating Wallpapers peeling off tired furnishings marks on the walls roller blinds not working etc It is not worth the 4 star rating 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a double room room I had booked a twin room as I was travelling with a work colleague to a conference for work The curtains in the room were filthy and hanging off the wall and we were right next to the lift and we could hear it all night 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are very old and the furniture as well The bed is not comfortable the pillows were flat And the cleaners were noisy at the morning couldn t sleep well 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was cold bacon mushrooms beans hash browns due to poor food warmers The decor was in need of decoration doors were chipped and wallpaper a bit grubby and tired looking
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel particularly our room in desperate need of a refurbishment Very very tired looking hotel tired looking room and bathroom Was advertised as being discounted from 800 night Like they say if it looks to good to be true it usually is 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dinner was awful and breakfast was shambles with half the dishes missing Staff tried but could not understand English well so communication was hopeless Bedroom was very tired with frayed carpets and the bathroom so tiny that if a person was large they could not sit on the toilet Pillows so thin that we needed to ask for 5 each in total to get a decent nights sleep 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was no hot water or heating in the evening but they had fixed this thankfully by the morning these things happen Breakfast was included in the Booking but they have charged to my card taking this up with them these things should not happen 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, room a little small
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The heating in the room did not work we were supplied with a portable radiation so the room was cold untill you put the radiator on The hotel needs a make over the hallways and rooms are very tired 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The water pressure wasn t all that good and the shower was a bit poor as a result Room 500 I think would be a bit drafty in winter but quite acceptable in April and much to our joy the windows actually opened I don t want to be over critical as some appear to be we had a great weekend and had two good nights sleep and as we went to London to sight see and had two nights at the theatre booked the hotel met the needs we had perfectly well 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel a bit run down and noise outside on the street can be heard by night in the rooms no double glazed windows 50 hold on card when arriving two to three days to get back into account yet to see if it arrives back in Breakfast and everything else besides the cost of the room is over priced 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was noisy as windows are single glazed 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room is run down Quite a pity given it s good location This is the first hotel I stayed in with socks on all the time as the carpet felt dirty and dusty 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Pillows weren t very good Plug in sink needs replacing TV not the best
Park Lane Mews Hotel, When we arrived for breakfast the restaurant was full they asked us to wait and then sat people that arrived after us first there was no consideration when we sat down for the full English breakfast there was no bacon no scrambled eggs no Fried eggs no hash brown The only thing that they had in plenty was mushrooms and tomatoes The staff were not organised and were rude at breakfast which was a shame as all the other staff were very pleasant
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was pokey Bed was small and uncomfortable Decor was dated Heating was substandard Shower took 5mins to heat up Bathroom couldn t accommodate 2 persons Premier Inn would have been a better option and better value for money 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, only one easy chair in the room
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel is tired Rooms need decorating Good value for a Sunday night deal but I would not want to pay anywhere near full rate for a very small basic room Again staff fantastic could not have been better 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is tired and in need of investment 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staffs in the breakfast room were offhand and just waved at the table they wanted you to sit at
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Some of the decoration and furniture could do with a spruce up however as we were only booked for an overnight stay we were not in the least bit concerned 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Awful breakfast not cheap but nasty would not purchase another First time we had had a room at the front beware the bin boys arrive at 6 20am About 20 large bins behind The Hilton Really noisy unless you are a heavy sleeper 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Should not be a 4 star no minibar no room service or at least doesn t take your breakfast order in the morning weak water pressure in shower flush not working well etc
Park Lane Mews Hotel, plumbing sink didn t drain properly toilet was hard to flush and sometimes didn t shower difficult to get hot Toaster broke

Park Lane Mews Hotel, My friend wanted de caf coffee for her breakfast The staff were Eastern European and could not understand what she wanted I am not racist but if I come to a London hotel I do expect all staff that have face to face contact with customers to be able to speak good English 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was in need of refurbishment and redecoration a little shabby but very clean and comfortable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs to be refurbished With investment and the existing staff plus rates this hotel would be a gem of a find in Mayfair 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noise pollution very hard to sleep Lack of organisation at breakfast no clean tables very slow service Very old fashioned hotel not as appears in photos Very overpriced 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not anything too dislike unless you are one of those people who moan for a living or have forgotten that please and thank you go along way 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel overall could use a make over I paid 199 and got one of the smallest rooms in the hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was a rodenticide trap in my room next to the air conditioning Disgusting The bed was worn out the carpet on the floor was disgusting The pillows were the thinest I ve ever experienced in a hotel the walls were dirty only one power plug in worked The toilet didn t flush in the bathroom and the sink never had hot water 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the room was expensive but due to it s location in London there were several plug sockets in the room but all were too close to a shelf to actually use meaning only 1 plug socket in the room was functional the room was a little dated with damp patches evident for the price i expected more
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The carpets in the room could have been cleaner but I m being picky here 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rat vermin traps in the bedroom head waiter in the resturant was very unhelpful we had to ask three times for a hot cup of tea coffee the food at breakfast was tepid warm not hot my husband did not eat any of his breakfast food hygine ratings being hidden behind a plant pot so that customers could not see the 2 star rating no appology from staff dirty untidy reception area hotel decor very tired needs updating

Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 The reception stuff not friendly 2 The bed not comfortable 3 Ther s no hot water and they keep laying to you that they will fix that issue but nothing happen until my last 4th night I decided to check out and say we will give discount from the amount that I already paid from Visa card every one uses it knows how that returns visas money not comfortable not satisfied returns At least it will take 5 to 7 days work tell the money back and if its not returned 4 Sample thing there s no Luggage carrying service 5 Brekfast is just thanks God I don t want to explain 6 Last night the reception nock the door and the ball during sleeping asking me if I ordered Sleeper the funny thing that was trying open the door Just imagine Not advanced from me 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hot water system had broken down and we had no hot water in our room for the duration of our stay Therefore no baths or showers taken The staff were very apologetic and gave us a 35 discount on our booking Apparently the hotel were waiting for a part for the boiler Nobody mentioned this to us when we checked in it only came to light when we complained The hotel would benefit from a refurbishment 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Sadly the boiler was not functioning properly so a low pressure warmish shower on a cold night was not great 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff were pretty bad Very vacant check in staff I had to wait at the reception for ten minutes before I was dealt with Not an ideal welcome Check out was worse The girls attitude verged on rude Very tired hotel Needs a major overhaul 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was no hot water available in the hotel and one of my colleagues had to ask for a change of mattress as the one that was on the bed originally was very old
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water in the evening or morning the internet didn t work properly there was no desk or chair to use for work and the heating didn t work there was an electric radiator which didn t warm the room enough 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water for a shower or wash noise from road outside bin men at 2 in the morning plus staff from the Hilton hotel opposite outside smoking and talking loudly Room decor very tired looking
Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 Rooms were too old and small I could hardly keep my medium sized suitcase at a double bed room 2 Hotel heating system didn t work during my travel They changed my room 3 times but it was still same Later they gave me 2 mobile electric heaters so somehow it was managed I was listenning others to complain same So while travelling in winter one must ask ahead 3 Window leaks cold air from outside 4 Doesn t provide free toothbrush or tooth paste 5 I wanted to borrow an electric plug pin converter but they had none 6 Very few TV channels
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small but you expect this in central London There were no tea bags in the room and although I rang to request some none were brought to the room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything except the staff
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Thought it would be a real treat to stay there but it wasnt Excellent location but a tired looking place needs updating and a good clean The lifts were scruffy and curtains were hanging off the rail in reception not a good welcome The toilet in the room was without windows or fan so you could just smell the loo the whole time Heating not working so a small portable radiator was placed there Just disappointed I would never stay there again cost a lot of money Spend your money elsewhere
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There is nothing that you can dislike about this hotel and staff 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the receptionist the day I checked out who wanted to kick me out at 12 00 knowing that when I checked IN the day before around 23 30 it had been agreed that I would check out at 13 00
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff on the evening when we had something to eat was a bit frosty when ordering our food the hotel is nice just it s appearance could do with being updated the room was pleasant the plunger in the sink wasn t working so we reported that breakfast room was small we didn t feel comfortable as everyone was very close when sitting at a table reception area was also used for breakfast 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Advertised as 4 star hotel hardly worthy of 2 The entire hotel is in desperate need of maintenance and updating Some staff great the rest can t understand English The most serious issue is the fact that disabled people have to use a side door once the furniture is moved out of the way due to the age of the building that is not the problem and some staff are unable to open this door If there is to be a fire The breakfast I asked for bacon sausage and a fried egg Got bacon and sausage as well as beans mushroom tomato hash brown and scrambled egg Asked for fried egg again still waiting for it 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room had been cleaned but was old musty and still felt dirty shabby The bathroom was shambolic You had to climb over the toilet which didn t flush adequately to get into the shower a large person would not have been able to do this The sink water did not run away for ages and you could not pop up the plug sufficiently At breakfast the staff only 2 were so overworked and they ran out of clean cups Not their finest hour 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast room small it could not accommodate all residents resulting in queues for sitting Also only two staff on duty who were helpful but frazzled 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, All great
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The faculty is old and not well preserved The internet connection was poor and I desperately needed it since I was on a business trip I had to connect to the internet via roaming The bathroom was small and the shower definitely old uncomfortable Elevators are very badly preserved Overall the faculty is a very poor
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bathrooms corridors tired early refurbishment overdue Hilton Hyde Staff smoking point noisy early hrs a m delivery lorry prompted room change room UPGRADE Great response 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Incredibly uncomfortable and rather small double bed I struggled to sleep and was turning constantly all night 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything was perfect for me except the heater was not working in my room Staff were aware with the problem They provided an external mini heater in the room which didn t help though in 2 degrees temperature night It was freezing and Couldn t sleep well from the cold draft comming from ventilation caught a bad cold Heating in such cold weather is basic essential 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was dirty there were no hot water that i could not have a shower and had to changed my hotel the next morning Also wifi was not working I wonder how this hotel marked as 4 star hotel in London 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only down side is the rooms need to be updated also very loud noises from traffic bin men could do with window Being changed 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The requested double bed was two very tired twin beds pushed together One had a huge dip in the middle and the other had large springs sticking out the side 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, A bit noisy when the bins are emptied at 4am Local parking is VERY expensive but it is in London 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very sad and desperately needs an upgrade Heating not working so oil heaters in the room Paintwork all cracked and chipping carpets dirty and stained Has an odour of old frying fat in the lifts and reception We stayed here 20 years ago and it seems nothing has been done since then Such a shame 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hot water in the morning but think they had a problem with the boiler as there were also plug in rads in the room Was very noisy at 6am when the dustbin lorry came Also could hear every time a door in the corridor shut This this is because it is an old hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Power sockets on the wall fixed too low and close to the surface of bench which is un adjustable so could not plugin any adapter or plug with cable protruding from the bottom of the charger adapter plug 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It needs refurbishment NOW Without heating in London with 0 degrees was problem I got cold and two days I am out of the office They had a small additional rediator Just to mention that I had an oil to apply for my moist ache and when I tried it was frozen like a cream This is unecceptable If they new that they have problem they should change our room If was general they should supply all rooms with bigger This is an excuse especially when you stay one night I asked the lady and she said they had problem So I do not care I could say the same that I have problem and I cannot pay them The heating is the most important Next step is to claim my money from booking and I will do that 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The front of the hotel was very noisy due to staff working at opposite hotel and smoking outside in large groups it was ridiculously noisy and unnecessary really
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Patchy Wi Fi a little dated in parts not really an issue but would have expected a bit more from a Genting property 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I must have been given one of the older rooms which needed refurbishment Room 501 On entering the room I noticed a portable electric heater which should have rang alarm bells I didn t have time to speak to reception to ask for another room as I had to depart quickly for an evening function Once back to the hotel and during my sleep I awoke feeling cold and had to put an extra blanket on the bed Even with the electric heater on full the room was freezing The bathroom extract fan was so powerful and noisy it was pulling high volumes of cold air through the leaky window adjacent to the bed making it draughty The repeated noise of the nearby lift through the early hours didn t help either Poor hot water pressure and flow in the bathroom topped off the experience Other than that the staff were friendly and breakfast was good Avoid Room 501 if you re offered it 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was cold despite a small electric radiator that had been added Fan in bathroom sounded like a diesel generator and you couldn t switch it off Tried heating airconditioning but that was also very noisey like a jet engine so switched off Water was cold for bath and shower
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the breakfast was cold it did not taste nice How can they get this wrong the corridors and rooms were dated in need of a refurb decorate We were upgraded to a King room I would like to of seen a Double room to compare very disappointing we wasnt impressed with the room and shower facilities It didnt feellike a 4 hotel Real shame
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bed was very cold no quilts just sheet and room was cold all night Breakfast cold and not appetising Paid a considerable amount for below average hotel Would not return or recommend 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was a little small no mini bar or safe and lacked in cupboard space Hard bed and room needed a little sprucing up Nothing disastrously bad just minor niggles 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, In need of a lick of paint general updating 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, very shabby public areas especially in toilet area Repairs made to bathroom very poor cracked ties etc Overall the hotel needs to be decorated and brought out of the 1980 s
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No TV remote in the room staff very bewildered and couldn t come up with a solution Wrong breakfast delivered in the morning Staff not particularly friendly except one guy serving breakfast Nothing major just small annoyances but brings down your opinion of the place 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Uncomfortable bed very old you can feel the metal bit coming out everything is very old I was quite surprised such a beautiful area but is very poorly and old design Hotel they need loads of investing me and boyfriend try to change it the other room but there all same room shame poor service they didnt fine my booking half an hour we were already late other meting in london many other thinks anyway bad experience will never go there again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was a little worn out but great otherwise I will return so not really an issue
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No wifi or non existent Really struggled for entertainment in room No one picked the phones to Didn t have synthetic duvets Woken up at 6am with those getting breakfast ready Seriously spend your money elsewhere I was allergic to dust and guess what drawers full of dust Hotels tired looking 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Did not get the type of room that was paid for in advance Had to pay an extra 40 on arrival and even then it was still not as it looked in the photos Room was not recently refurbished as described Did not have a walk in shower as shown in photos Room was very very dated Stains on walls and carpets tiles damaged wallpaper ripped etc 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was tiny shabby and not the cleanest I also had two mobile radiators in my room which left even less space to move about Not worth the 130 price tag for room only Would not recommend 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms were really dated Needs a bit of an upgrade for the price 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was small and had received what must of been a very basic clean so it was quite dirty in the corners and dusty throughout Generally very old decor greatly in need of investment to update it Odd perfumed scent attempted to mask the old smell in the room when we first walked in The heating didn t work properly so they had a little heater on full blast when we arrived it must of been running all day as the room was like a sauna The mattress was unbelievable uncomfortable with broken springs in places The bedding was clean but didn t smell fresh Like they d been through a very hot wash thousands of times but never replaced All in all a hotel where the staff are great but let down hugely by lack of investment and proper cleaning 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, This was NOT a 4 hotel as advertised Although clean the rooms were a joke 120 to stay in a very cramped dated not centrally heated room is ridiculous furniture is strained and battered Plug Sockets are un useable being located so low to counter tops not leaving enough space for cables We had to unplug our only heater to charge phones leaving the room freezing I would give this hotel a 2 5 Star Max and wouldnt pay more than 50 Per night 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, A We had to change our room 3 times before we got one that was even close to being habitable B First room carpet torn and heavily stained The bed linen appeared to have been used before C Bedroom 2 the mattress was old and the edges were only 5 deep and broken down It was also very stained with blood and bodily fluids No proper mattress protector and the four pillows were thin 2 and old D Throughout our stay we spoke to the Head of Housekeeping a number of times regarding the quality of the rooms and she informed us that almost ALL the rooms were in this condition It was only thanks to her intervention that we finally were moved to a room that was satisfactory E The Hotel was tatty and run down in appearance Our understanding from your website that this Hotel has a 4 Star rating Sadly this is not the case F Since we selected this hotel on the basis that we were booking 4 star accommodation we are prepared to pay the full price for the two nights where the room was satisfactory however we feel that a full refund for the three previous nights would be appropriate G The above were the main issues more listed below 1 Duvets wafer thin 2 Odd cups chipped 3 bathrobe one for 2 people 4 Unfinished furniture in room no doors on armoire 5 All paintwork chipped and damaged 6 Peeling wallpaper Etc Etc Photographs are available if required We look forward to your early response John and Jan Summerfield
Park Lane Mews Hotel, What didnt we like most things To start with beds were by far the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept in It felt as if it was falling apart and for that reason very noisey Both myself and colleague shared a twin room 302 heating was broken freezing cold night only 3 working plugs in the room how are business people meant to work Carpets were really dirty also which is very off putting Huge draft through the window made our night totally horrific it was freezing made sense why there was a portable heater in the room which was useless Pillows were falling apart i had to sleep my head on a blanket we were also awoken to the bin men right outside our window at 6 am for a solid 40 minutes For 10 cheaper i could have stayed at the Millenium hotel just down the road which is by far much more superior and also much better value for money Its not even a cheap hotel to warrant having such bad qualities 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast staff couldn t even muster up a small smile all morning Very loud rooms single glazed window right outside loading bay 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, We stayed in this hotel 25th 27th dec 2016 Our phone charger was found lost at 4pm 26th dec 2016 All our personal toiletries total of nine items were found lost when we back from dinner at 9pm Reception staff apologized and promised to find our lost belongings We kept calling the hotel on 28th 29th 30th for any updates Reception manger named Jiada told us none of the items were found and she will forward this to her manager who is on holiday till 4th jan 2017 We then left our email address for them to contact because we are flying aboard for new year We wrote two e mails to contact the hotel on 9th jan 2017 and 22nd jan 2017 It is been almost a month We are still waiting for the response from the hotel yet no one appears Just to warn any potential travellers to think twice before you make the reservation with this hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cold bathroom too small and very old
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not enough space at breakfast for all the guests needed to wait for a table and the food was in short supply The rooms are basic and the whole hotel is run down but fairly clean 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, We had a fuse blow in the room causing the lighting to fail completely Apart from socket lighting We phoned reception and some 10 mins later a porter arrived with a light bulb He realised it was the fuse problem saying he could not do it We were left to get ready with no lighting which consisted of showering then hair drying and makeup to be done Hence no one returned to fix the fuse I reported it once again to Reception when booking out of hotel To which she replied she would get someone to look at it To which I replied well that s not going to help us now is it 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was so hot I managed to open the widow which was not easy other than this small point everything was ok 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Erm oh the bathroom was a tiny bit small and whilst it had a lovely looking tub the hot water pressure was not enough that you could have successfully run an bath But that is pretty much nitpicking 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The property is looking slightly tired but fine for an overnight stay
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was extremely shabby Soft furnishings furniture was completely worn out I m glad we didn t pay very much however it s no excuse for shabby rooms
Park Lane Mews Hotel, All rooms are very tired and need of new paint and decorating They were cold too and each had a plug in oil heater One of my business guests had a cracked window in his room they did kindly change his room though noise level outside was bad too 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The upgrade wasn t particularly special I wonder what the 150 night would have gotten us if we didn t get an upgrade Very expensive for something that isn t at all modern We were in a room facing the street and it was noisy even though we were a little off the Main Street It was quite old fashioned 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room a little tired and in need of updating Mattress not terribly comfortable Couldn t open window to let fresh air in 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel room badly needs to be renovated as the carpet is worn and the rest of the room is quite dated and suffering from long term effects of wear and tear 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, My room felt like the servant s quarters The curtains didn t close which was a shame as there was a draught coming in from the window Heating was provided by a small electrical oil filled radiator Due to lack of space and electric sockets I had to choose between heat and charging my phone The decor was very tired In particular the carpet was covered in burn marks and was very frayed 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The curtains drapped either side of the window only had a few hooks eyes so didn t hang right could ot be drawn also the room had to have an free standing electric heater to heat the room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was a whistling machine outside in the street so it was little bit annoying Municipality services for the trash started at 5 am outside it was too early to get up for a vacation
Park Lane Mews Hotel, We had a little problem with the water of the bathtub which drenched the moquet going through the walls but we were immediately moved to another room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room cramped and really knackered Breakfast was very unappetising and dull Have had better in what would be considered a poorer quality hotel Definitely not worth the price and wont make that mistake again
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Beds hard run down more like a 2 star disappointing
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are not correctly described on site of booking com It is definitely not 4 stars hotel We have coffee and tea only on first day in the room then no one check and add more 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noisy dirty poorly maintained lack of service wrongly rated I have photos of taps dripping sink with waste water that wouldn t empty hairs on toilet seats the list goes on and on Save your hard earned cash We are a late 30s and early 40s professional couple normal couple with normal expectations 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was over priced for the condition The bed was absolutely terrible and the slight movement the whole hotel could hear you 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cleaners tried getting us to clock out at 8 30 am even though clock out is suppose to be at 12 so we sent them away and they came back at 11 and told us we had to leave 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms are a bit tired some are small this our third stay at the hotel and understand it could be possibly refurbished next year Very good staff
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bed was like a brick pillows flat room had not been decorated since the 80 s Electric heater on floor bathroom dirty 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Instead of a double bed the put 2 twin beds together AC not working 2 heaters in the room were already there Noise from the street all night and in the morning from loading and unloading Lots of noise from the cleaning staff on the hallway Dirty bathroom trashbin door Carpet dirty The shower was not working we had to use the tub
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Xmas tree looked awrful Walking down park lane at other hotels there trees were gorgeous Don t think it would have coat to much to have a really nice Xmas tree in reception would have made such a difference Only other point was the staff from the Hilton hotel at night they seems to use the area at the front of your hotel to have a smoke and a chat it goes no on and off throughout the night Emptying the bins was not really a problem but did wake us up
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel was lovely and the staff extremely friendly and helpful The only thing that let it down was the fact the the room was very tired and desperately in need of work There were marks on the wallpaper the skirting boards were completely covered with scrapes and very large scratches and the lamp shades were badly damaged with holes and rips in nearly all of them Everything else about our stay and the hotel was wonderful 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff service and location
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the beds were not realy made up just closed without even streching the part on the matras 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No hairdryer in the room Receptionists were not helpful were not able to assist with such a simple thing as printing the flight tickets 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, 2 parts of bed base did not line up causing a bruise walking past in the small room Heating not working room overheated by portable electric heater opened window but noise from road works and the Hilton s extraction plant was a nuisance 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No real complaints other than it being a little tired 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I had inadequate heating in my room and lacked the ability to resolve the situation Very very poor service and response to my complaint Rooms haven t been decorated for 10 years 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is completely run down and booking com should have had something of note on this fact displayed on the listing I booked the most expensive room on the site there were 5 available at time I booked I went most expensive because the picture and description let me believe it was the best room at the hotel Very far from it The room was a dump It was very old and dingy What pissed me off was that I was charged 289 when for 30 more I could have stayed at the Hilton in a better room Management absolutely would not adjust my pricing to reflect the standard dumpy room rate of 145 Instead they offered to move me to a bigger room which I agreed to and they did Natalie the manager on duty at the time could not have been more professional She did her best to reason with me and to liaise with their corporate office Natalie was a star My recommendation don t stay at this hotel Seriously for a bit more stay at the Hilton if price is an issue anyway you should not be looking at rooms in Mayfair 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms need to updated urgently tatty cold cramped very noisy at night double glazing needed on windows someone try to enter our room in the early hours it was only the security chain that stop them coming in very scary we won t be staying at the hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was tiny you had to close the door in the bathroom to be able to move around and I could touch both sides of the room whilst stood in front of the window where the tv had been positioned due to the lack of wall space the dirty carpet with two large holes where furniture had warn through to the floor boards topped it off 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were rude I asked if I could swap rooms as my room was noisy the girl didn t even lift her head and said no the site closes in 2 hours Same member of staff the next day was rude again when checking out again didn t lift her head when I asked where a hair salon would be to get my hair done No air con in rooms Big disappointment and wouldn t want to stay again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Receptionist offered a discount on the breakfast if we paid at check in After that it was not available However if you booked a room directly on the hotel site a complimentary breakfast was included in a lower price than booking com The rooms are filthy They put a queen size bed in a room large enough for a twin bed and call this deluxe The staff is surly What is to like about this place The establishment overrates its accommodations We reserved a deluxe room the first room we had was sub standard and filthy We requested a change to a deluxe room and were moved to a slightly better room Both rooms were very low end When we requested a rate adjustment for the difference between deluxe and standard a difference of 150 pounds they gave us a 50 pound courtesy rebate hardly a sufficient adjustment They admitted to the low quality but did nothing about properly adjusting the rates Booking com responded to correspondence daily requesting copies of the bill then copies of my credit card statement and then finally refusing to do anything unless I provided photos of the room Beware of Booking com and this hotel Also take photos of everything questionable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I was thirsty as we were checking out and I asked the waitress if I could just have a little glass of juice set up for breakfast but she said as I hadn t paid for breakfast I couldn t have a drink Nice 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were very dated scruffy with rips in the carpet Not worth the cost of the stay This hotel is trying to be very posh succeeds until you get in the lift 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was dated carpet dirty scruffy wallpaper shabby furniture broken kettle lid only 4 milk portion 1 packet of biscuit tap in bathroom sink had a broken seal not worthy of a four star very upset suppose to have been a delux room we complained about the first room we were shown and this one was the better of the two Also tv reception awful curtains were of the bracket so didn t meet in the middle when shut 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was really small and quite noisy The plugs were ridiculously placed so near to the counter top that you couldn t get a plug in 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, A real radiator in the room room 502 one connected to the central heating would have been nice There was a broken sort of heating unit under the window Heavier curtains that actually close to block off the window in addition to the thin blind would be good too I appreciate I was in a single room and these are often overlooked by hotels as if we do not matter but to be up in the roof space in a poky room with a tiny electric oil fired radiator plugged in well I think you can do better The duvet was as thin as a pancake and not at all warm I needed the towelling bathrobe on top of my bed and a jumper to sleep in The radiator was plugged into the only useable 13amp socket in the room This is because the other sockets are placed so low down you cannot get a plug into them without damaging the flex So for charging phones using a laptop I had to unplug my only heating source Plus at 6am in the morning the shower was not hot enough 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rather tatty Tiles coming off in the tiny bathroom Very small bedroom Needs re decorating a lot of chipped paint and wallpaper coming off Some of the staff very difficult to understand Had to put down a 50 deposit as well as paying up on arrival 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Dated In urgent need of a renovation Small rooms dates furtniture Ancient tv would have been better to not have had a tv in the room I used my laptop 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, 2nd time there both times overhearing other guests having problems with their bookings Hard beds 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff were not friendly on check in the welcome was poor staff going about their business not really acknowledging a new customer but simply processing us taking our money and the departure staff were not interested how the stay had been They also allowed other guests to interrupt rather than ensuring that our departure was efficiently sorted out before dealing with them We didn t have breakfast but it didn t look worth 17 per person seemed excessive even for London Although check out was 12noon from 9 30am the housekeeping staff were knocking on the door to see when we were leaving Bed wasn t comfy and pillows flat as pancakes neither my daughter nor I slept well we wouldn t chose this hotel again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff in the dining room could have been a little more friendly Some of the decor is very tired 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Shabby room which has not seen investment in years Generally tired and faded furniture and fittings Carpets well worn This hotel needs a refurbishment badly Reception staff off hand No payment receipt available and one is required to pay on arrival not on departure Perhaps because nobody was at reception in the morning it just reflects how capital and operating costs are run at a bare minimum Will not return 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small it was not very clean there were marks on the bedding as you entered the room 110 the frayed carpet I caught my foot in there was very little interaction from staff they only spoke to take my payment told me nothing about breakfast the facilities and didn t make me feel welcome at all The room was old and cold and I was disturbed in the morning by my bell ringing asking if I had reported my heater not working I hadn t reported it but anyway in summary I don t think I have ever stayed somewhere before and not had a friendly welcome or any information just the simple things although the room sink and toilet could of been cleaned better as itvx
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very dated The whole hotel is dirty the rooms are gloomy we had to move room once as the first room smelt really bad The second room was not much better but we just had to get on with it as they would not refund us our money so we could go somewhere else The staff are rude and not bothered in customer service The breakfast is 16 for dry bacon and dry beans I would never stay here again and don t recommend anyone too There are much cheaper better hotels Wish I would of read the review first I am not a person to complain about silly things but this really is a joke 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The cleanliness of the room was poor Wall paper falling off the walls Marker pen over the walls The toilet was in a disgusting condition Looked very old In need of decorating throughout Expect much better from a hotel in park lane 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, we were told our room was upgraded and it didn t seem to be Their was also no wardrobe in the room which I found difficult to believe in this day and age the handy man decided to varnish our door when we were in our room and told me to watch my suit when I came out of the room later a sign went on the door for wet paint what is that all about 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Although the exterior of hotel was very pretty the rooms were very run down and in desperate need of updating so much so that the room and bathroom felt dirty 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was dirty There was a water leak in the room making the carpet drenched Amenities were very run down Very expensive for the quality 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Unfortunately there was not hot water in our room the evening we arrived I booked 3 rooms 2 of which were at the front of the hotel and both couples were woken at 6 30 in the morning with workmen outside 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It is very Shabby The small room was clean thankfully The front desk folks were nice but really had no idea about finding out little things I would not recommend this to anyone unless they prefer shabby The whole place needs to closed for a makeover 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Noisy during the night I know we were in Central London but this was because we couldn t shut the window due to the Ac unit outlet being placed in the gap 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was over cooked and dried out Staff not particularly friendly The Room was shabby The lift was out of order as was the toilets Overall incredibly disappointing
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It s a tired hotel in terms of finish but not a reason I wouldn t go back there 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel has not seen any renovation for years My room had a carpet that looked pretty disgusting at some places Also the shower did not work properly it only knew hot or steaming hot 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast was cold limited variety and empty when we arrived at 9 Staff were not helpful they were cold and everything felt like a chore for them Moody is a word I would use for one of them It was not worth 11 95 each The bed was horrible felt every spring The room was not what we thought from the pictures on the site but felt like a fair size We were front facing so the blue light outside came on at night and our curtain had a few pegs missing so had gaps of light The staff at front desk were not forthcoming or helpful Somewhat rude answering the phone whilst speaking to us 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, A sheet on the bed rather than just a duvet But the air conditioning was brilliant during an exceptionally hot spell of weather 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioning unit is on the inside of the room and it makes a racket It is impossible to sleep wit it on It couldn t be switched off by us or staff so had to take the fuse out the wall The whole Hotel needs an upgrade 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The service at breakfast was slow this time but this is the first time we encountered this the waiting staff were doing their best but another pair of hands would have helped We would prefer a teapot on the table so we can refill anytime without having to wait to be served this would also help the staff this was on offer when we first started using the hotel The room we had was smaller than the ones we normally have for the same price and it was looking a bit tired but we realised that there were going to be some alterations which didn t happen 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, D cor was looking tired 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Everything was bad Was given wrong room on arrival Carpet dirty Bed dirty Hairs in bed Hairs in towels Everything smelled awful Bed the most uncomfortable ever like sleeping on rocks Noises coming from everywhere including a 3am bang on my door Whole place in desperate need of refurb Even then I wouldn t go back purely based on this experience and the fact that my email of complaint has still not been answered almost 1 week later 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I didn t like the look of the Executive Double room we we re staying in The bed was clearly very old as it has a dent in it and made a lot of noise as well as the room being muggy and old Had to pay an extra 7 on top of the 22 breakfast charge to have breakfast in bed which annoyed me 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast items could have been replenished more promptly but that was not a major problem 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast is too pricey 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Size of room was very small D cor in the room was very tired with a musty smell in the room TV was very poor quality and signal poor Bathroom was very cramp and not very welcoming Unlikely I would stay here again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, This hotel needs a complete refurb Rooms very small and worn out Carpets frayed walls damaged and dirty Bathroom patched grout and woodwork chipped and damaged Whole place is outdated and needs complete refurb
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The a c did not work in my room they said they d fix it they did not As I was leaving my room the next day a maid fixed it in 1 second We were miserable in our room all night in the heat We did not need to be They did not seem to care We had to park across at the Hilton for our car Although it was not that bad price wise or distance 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The disabled facilities at the property weren t the best The wheelchair had to be wheeled in through the restaurant where chairs and tables had to be moved around so the chair could pass through every single time we came in or left the hotel The disabled room was pretty small for a wheelchair 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff has not checked the request I have asked which was not to disclosed the price of the room which I ve paid in cash but instead he shouted out loud how much was it Bad bad
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The first room we got into Was not what I saw on the photos And to upgrade it cost me another 40
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Our room was very tired looking The wallpaper really let the room down as it was grubby shabby looking which considering this was a four star was a bit disappointing However that said it didn t affect our stay in way way whatsoever 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It was very old and dirty Needs renovation The coplete cost of the trip was requested to be drawn on the first day No mini fridge no case to lock important belongings such as passport 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Receptionist was more interested in a taxi drivers problems and it took 15 minutes to book in 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, needs complete renewal Old furniture very few TV channels of poor quality picture noisy air con Didn t take breakfast there quite expensive and there are lots of cafes around
Park Lane Mews Hotel, room and bathroom door are old room key is not working well because the door is broken TV channels are limited
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast variety cost Also for the hotel s business benefit if the concierge services includes the intermediaries go between tour bus transportation services purchase the skip line for the various museums with a minimum charges it would bring more business to the hotel and the helpful to the tourists Finally pay attention a little more in up keeping the room cleaning services 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The pictures that is show on booking is different from reality when it comes to the room No water in the rooms even the big ones The Ac is very loud the blanket I saw the one under the cover looks old and rotten Check ur self
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Check in not great didn t take my card so caused problems when trying to order room service Key card stopped working halfway through stay Lifts were fairly temperamental which meant going up and down three flights of stairs most the time AC unit in the room was incredibly loud which meant you couldn t sleep with it running Just lots of niggles caused by a lack of attention to detail really and below par service not really what you d expect from such a great location Would be hesitant to book again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room service maintenance was very poor we had a dirty chair in the room the curtain was partly hanging down the shower curtain was smelly also the one it was replaced with after we had complained only the third one was ok there were piles of dust on the floor underneath the beds table surfaces in the lobby were wiped with an apparently dirty cloth you could see the smear on the tables Our room was quite small for the amount of money we paid No place to put the suitcases There were no hangers on the walls in the room where you could put jackets etc While all the male waiters at breakfast were really friendly helpful and nice the waitress was not 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, On arrival at the Reception Desk I was questioned if I was booked in the hotel as the lady on the reception couldn t find my booking I showed the lady my printed version of my Booking com reservation for Two Nights and still couldn t find me I was then asked if I was booked in another hotel and if I came to the wrong one After 5mins they found me and only for one night I did say it s booked for two nights and then was asked for Photo ID to prove who I was The rooms are very dated side units were damaged Sink full of weed like substance upon arrival cups with the Tea Facilities need a good cleaning beforehand Asked for a free map on arrival through Booking com and didn t get one Overall Location fantastic but Checking In very poor Rooms dated Also if you don t want to pay 16 95 for breakfast at Hotel nice little Caf 3min walk away opens at 8am 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, the hotel sells it self as air conditioned i discovered on one of London s hottest weeks of the Summer that the air conditioning had broken down 2 days earlier and they were waiting it to be fixed put up with a room with no airconditioned the bedroom temperature reached 40 C plus a disgrace of a hotel
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hot water was an issue on ONE day 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The mattress was really uncomfortable pillows and bedding very basic and d cor and furniture tired The poorest 4 star I have stayed in and a very small room A shower curtain in the bathroom which is never good 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air conditioning not functioning in room 407 on 20th July Window screwed in to a fixed position so no external air flow encouraged Staff attempted to find me a fan but this did not show up Resorted to jamming room door open with the solitary chair in order to try and encourage air flow Eventually lay down the wrong way round on the bed gasping for air from the warm breeze created by the malfunctioning aircon resembling a swaety goldfish deprived of oxygen about 2 hours sleep achieved so abt 120 per hour of sleep 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Air con was a free standing unit that sounded like a plane was landing impossible to sleep with it on Wifi was far too slow TV had few channels and terrible picture bed was lumpy and all furniture was dated
Park Lane Mews Hotel, very small bathroom You almost step in the toilet getting out of the bathtub You need to shower in the bath
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast was very disappointing corporate and unimaginative very pre packaged 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The aircon in the room left a lot to be desired but it is only a small niggle and was only heightened because of how hot it was while we were there 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fact that while we were waiting in the lounge area it was extremely obvious that a man was checking into the hotel with two prostitutes The clerk said the room is only for two people and the guest said they won t be staying long a little disturbing
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only issue is hotel is tired and dated 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room carpet was dirty I dropped a tie and looked under the bed and was met with a thick layer of dust The air conditioning didnt work so a mobile untit was positioned in the corner An air pipe led from the air con to an open window 1 the noise of the adjoining street was heard and rhe mobile unit was uncomfortably loud The doors were scratched whick matched the state of the decor The bathroom was clean Though the towels were mean and thin Breakfast is NOT worth the money Do not be talked into it It looks good but is poor Using Booking com I got a great rate booked some monthes in advance Sadly that cheap rate which was NOT the ceapest room they offered also met that I did not get a decent room Pay LESS and dont stay here Go and boom somewhere a little further away 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Furniture very worn and TV didn t work on our second day 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Being given the key to a room that had someone still resident Luckily they were out but their possessions etc were in the room when we entered Had to take the receptionist to see it and be given a different room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Issues at check in resolved ultimately a good stay Had booked 3 twin rooms but none were available on the day We were allocated 3 super king size rooms which luckily for our group of girls was suitable Disappointed by this as there were 3 available twin rooms at the time of booking which is why we chose this hotel The rate was the same The receptionist sent 2 bottles of wine to one room as an apology We appreciated this gesture were happy with the rooms given but would have preferred the combinations we had booked well in advance 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Tired property in desperate need of renovation Staff without motivation and without any idea of customer service Would prefer to sit a chat between themselves rather than check customers in Breakfast awful should have gone to Pret to get considerably better at a quarter of the price I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and it has gone down hill terribly A hotel to be avoided 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It has a trousers iron machine attached to the wall The lights of the corridor are snow white The carpets are old and a bit smelly The walls and doors are full of scratches Needs renovation 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, air conditioning didn t work everything was very tired staff did their best but their english was quite limited and they were largely untrained 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was small tired peeling paint and dull colours The safe did not work and was told by reception we know about that thanks for telling us but they did make alternative provision On arrival there was a breakfast offer which we took up to be told the next day by the man on reception we had not His very poor response was to say that the offer was only available if booked on arrival which we had and that as he had no record we had not Had to make a bit of a fuss which at least the restaurant manager understood what I was saying The man on reception has no understanding of customer service 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cab arranged on the way back to the airport was unprofessional and rude He would only accept cash which we were not informed about at the hotel and initially refused to issue is a receipt 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fabric of the Hotel was a little thread bare and the Hotel decor in general was in need of a make over Rather over priced for the state of the decor
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff said everything right but it was unconvincing No eye contact only responded to direct questions Aptitude fine attitude needs work 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The only thing we didn t like was the fact that we had not booked a longer stay 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very nisy all through night staff at Hilton opposite stand outside the mews in their breaks for smoking and are very very noisy if you are in a room at the front of the hitel
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff and management was rude and extremely unhelpful We paid for accommodation on bookings com When we got to the hotel they made us pay again So we paid double accommodation The reception lady was the rudest and most unfriendly person we have ever come across The tap in the bathroom was broken The plug was broken The room was tiny The air conditioning was broken There was a portable aircon that was put in the room by the window in essence the window had to stay open the entire night and we could not get any sleep as we could hear all the noise from the street with the window being open Park Lane Mews hotel was the most expensive in the area Did not include breakfast Whenever we asked for assistance everyone treated us badly and made us feel like we are a problem to them This is without a doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed at and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bacon at breakfast tasted awful I have never had bacon that had such a horrid taste I couldn t eat it and we were looking forward to a nice breakfast wouldn t have it again The hotel drastically needs decorating bedrooms landings etc 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was very dated plus us to leave 50 damage deposit I could understand if we were 18 and in Ibiza but not 45 and in Park Lane We checked out before the cleaners have gone in to decide whether we had to pay any sort of damage which I think is so wrong because you got to keep checking your bank account to see if it s been taken
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel is very out dated and everything looks and feels very old Room didn t have a hair dryer and the bed and pillows weren t extremely comfortable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff very unhelpful and they found it difficult to understand what was happening with our booking simply because 2 rooms were booked by me but one room was down under my friends name Not asking them to do rocket science
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The rooms were tired wood work tatty very noisy air con units rooms too hot No water glasses or water in rooms Accessible entrance is into dining room but requires moving furniture to get wheelchair through Big kerb outside this entrance into Shepherds Mews so the long way around is necessary for wheelchairs 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was very small and the bath was very difficult to get in to as the room was so small The room was very dated and in urgent need of updating No mini bar And the hearing was stuck on Tv didn t work properly 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms tiny and cramped a huge air conditioning unit totally DIY with a huge exhaust hose going out the window Apart from this unit being noisy which made it impossible to sleep with it on it also took a good part of the room There is no mini bar or fridge or safe in ANY of the rooms the furniture is extremely old the cover of the one chair in the room was in tatters The general condition of the hotel is not up to standard All this at an exorbitant price Never again will I come to this hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very noisy from the rear of the opposite hotel during the night as the talked very loud while smoking etc 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bedroom was a little cramped although small the bed proved comfortable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bill had to be settled immediately on arrival This is very poor practise You should always pay on checkout AFTER you have enjoyed the stay 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, At peak time breakfast their isn t enough tables You either had to wait or have your breakfast in the bar lounge where you sunk into the sofas and it was very uncomfortable eating your breakfast
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The decor is looking very tired and dated it being a busy hotel we felt it should be maintained more often
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Receptionist seemed a little concerned that we had such a cheap rate from booking com And reminded us that it would be over 200 next time we wanted to stay The room was very small very basic and quite tired The bed springs were coming through the mattress so was quite an uncomfortable night Arrived for breakfast 10 mins before they stopped serving and instead of a good morning we were informed that we had 5 minutes left She seemed annoyed that we had arrived towards the end of service and that she wouldn t be able to clear down as early as she d hoped Poured us both cold coffee and because English wasn t her native tongue it was quite difficult to get it changed Quite an unpleasant experience all round really and wouldn t go back 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very small rooms but clean No water was provided which is quite bad and should be provided for the price paid Also the girl in the restaurant in the morning was not helpful at all and I found her quite rude as well 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Only downside was the early morning wake up provided by the refuse collectors 12 large bins to be emptied under our window at 0700
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms could use with an upgrade particularly the bathrooms
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Paid 189 for the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Twin room but one bed against the wall No room to move around Nowhere to put suitcases which were just overnight bags Loo didn t flush had to call maintenance Came promptly but made fun of us as we d not done it right He had to increase the in flow though Electric sockets are so close to counter top that the wire coming out of the bottom of the plug fouls the connection so we had to hold them in the wall while we charged our phones or used hair straighteners Breakfast bacon sausage was dry very disappointing as I had invited my son in law to join us as he was in town that day 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The sofas in the general lounge were badly stained and wood work in halls badly worn The wall paper in the rooms was tiered looking and the net curtains needed a good clean 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, On arrival at the hotel it was apparent that the standard of hygiene was below that you would expect from the prices of the facility The corridors were smelling of tobacco where guests had clearly been smoking indoors When we got to the room myself and my wife were uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning The very old air conditioning in the room had a damp smell that was reminiscent of drainage system The poor climate control was further hampered by the window being screwed closed Breakfast was equally disappointing and the response from the staff was typical of the experience I would not stay in this hotel again and nor would I recommend it to friends 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The fan was a bit noisy so turned it off and opened the window Shower not the best pressure but managed More tea bags would have been good 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel looks quite tired and could do with being updated I paid 139 for one night My friend booked shortly before me and paid 259 for two nights She had breakfast included I was advised that I required to pay 16 95 for breakfast I informed a member of staff that all I wanted was tea and toast She then required to speak to her colleague who in turn required to speak to someone else This took some time so by the time she informed me I could pay for tea and toast only my friends had finished their breakfast No discretion was used by the staff and I left the hotel hungry Not great customer service 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Old fashioned and shabby in places decor needs updating Slow service when checking in Some room features a bit impractical struggled to plug in hairdryer and phone charger due to impractical socket placement
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Just needs a little bit of tlc but that s not a complaint 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Can t expect every hotel to be perfect in every way although I agree with other guest s reviews the decor should have been changed a long time ago Not sure how good the double glazing is A great location and the hotel was reasonably priced for the centre of London Overall a good hotel experience but it could have been a great experience with a few tweaks and a focus on decor 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Layout of bathroom a bit on the small side small bath that was very high and could be difficult to get in out 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bar staff unable to open or pour champagne without spilling at least half a glass and still charged for the whole thing Very poor Dining room unable to cater for the amount of guests and nowhere to wait apart from 2 chairs right next to the cold buffet 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The photos were Nothing Iike the real thing The hotel was really shabby plastic plants outside a dirty building old cheap tatty furniture wardrobe doors that would not open mini fridge that could nt be opened without being on your knees to plug in and was empty trouser press hanging dangerously off the wall and dirty blinds up the windows Window over looked rear of Hilton hotel who had very noisy deliveries and bin collections 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms require refurbishment none of the power points were able to accommodate a plug from Apple as the points to close to the floor They have a big box that used to hold crt tv now they have old fashioned flat screen on top of it 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The internet service went down in the evening before I left Several phone calls to the front desk were met with the response that the router had been reset Only after about three hours did they acknowledge that the service was not functioning Nor was it restored prior to my departure Thus it was not functioning for the final 40 of my stay This was aggravating because I could accomplish no work and there was no solution to be had by the hotel The staff apologized but I know it was out of their hands and in the hands of the cable company who was on sight as I departed 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms are a bit small and cannot even open suitcases covers Otherwise everything was perfect
Park Lane Mews Hotel, some d cor a little tired one of the rooms had broken aircon tv didn t work Rooms a bit over heated 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The Hotels App to order Taxis not working We had to walk to nearest Taxi Rank not fun as disabled to get a Taxi to station Also a bit of a misunderstanding over room numbers meant I carried own ordered hot chocolates to room but this was no biggy Just a bit worrying staff member said our room did not exhist 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The staff couldn t be bothered to help our first encounter on entering the hotel was a young woman who said reception s not my job talk to him The second encounter was no better with the receptionist telling us his day was about to get better because his shift was nearly over He gave us 2 electronic keys and we had to ask where the room was because the receptionist hadn t said On entering the room a double accessible room we found the bed was pushed against the wall and was far from accessible There was mould growing on the walls the paper was hanging off the wall under the window and the carpet was frayed and dirty We returned to reception to ask if there was a more suitable room available and were told I am not authorised to move rooms you ll have to speak to the next person who come onto reception Needless to say we were disappointed as this was a birthday treat and whilst we were not paying the full rate we would have expected better service from a Mayfair hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Decor was a little tired and room a bit small
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cheapest in the area for a reason unfortunately 169 was still far too much for a cramped room with a tiny double bed and a shower that s shorter than me The shabby look I can deal with but the staff staring at us while we were waiting for friends in the reception bar area was a bit off The breakfast tasted of dust but I imagine it s difficult to find fresh ingredients when you re in central London I guess all of the other establishments have scooped them up Shouldn t moan as that was included in the price and service at breakfast again reminded us that it was cheap 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel needs a revamp and a damn good clean The reception gives you a sense of gradure and then beyond that it s stuck in the 80 s with dirty worn out furniture and carpets The room was disgusting The carpet was dirty and Ill fitted with peeling wall paper and the valance was stained and disgusting The toilet didn t even flush 169 wasted and the breakfast was equally awful The cooked breakfast was dripping in fat and then I asked for porridge that wasn t inc in the price and I was told I had to pay 4 20 Sadly that was equally awful so I left Hungry and totally disappointed Why didn t I complain The staff s English wasn t t good and i didn t speak their native tongue A truly awful hotel that is masked on this web page by the posh name and location 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Furniture and finishes could do with updating TV didn t work properly staff friendly and helpful but inexperienced so check in and out was slow 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, This is not a glossy business hotel It is rather old fashioned and a little worn The interior needs a touch of paint in places but I found the former charming and the latter acceptable given the overall level of service and the cost 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not much really perhaps the bed was a little small
Park Lane Mews Hotel, We book a twin room meaning two single beds but when we for there we found a gigantic double bed in our room and squeezed to the side of it was a tiny flimsy creaky and uncomfortable portable single bed which took up all of the remaining space in the room meaning we had no room for luggage at all As a result we had to get the portable bed removed and we had to sleep awkwardly on either side of the double bed The types of bed were the most important part of the room and they didn t get that thing right Absolutely unacceptable Water pressure in the shower head was tiny 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Extremely noisy room at the front of the hotel Delivery trucks from the very early hours to the Hilton Hotel over the road Rooms were very dated and not particularly clean The pest control box located in the dining room was rather off putting The beds were very noisy creaky etc and every time you moved they banged on the wall
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfastroom is to small
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Asked for quiet room Although inside hotel was reasonably quiet didn t expect to hear staff from Hilton laughing talking outside of our bedroom window 15 huge bins being emptied every morning before 7am However in saying this it would not put me off returning It was a nice clean room for the night 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms could do with some fresh wallpaper paint 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Nothing
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is falling to pieces I was in 501 I was not told it was a disabled room The carpet needs replacing very quickly filthy and coming up at the bathroom tread I put the chain on the door and tested it the frame came away The shower and bathroom were very old and dirty and battered The disabled shower was vintage There was almost no water pressure The soap dish fell to the floor as soon as I touched it The toiled roll holder fell to the floor as soon as I touched it The toilet was filthy and had not been properly cleaned for a very long time NEVER NEVER AGAIN 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was too warm and difficult to cool the controls on the A C were not clear Duvet we thought was rather small for the bed I am over 6 feet tall and it wouldn t cover both ends at once 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Contacting us when taxi was not ordered and we were waiting in reception and had to run in the rain to get one ourselves That was not acceptable 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel s public areas corridors and rooms feel dated and in need of refurbishment 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast and service at breakfast wasn t great Felt very disorganised and hectic Room was small very dated and bed was poor quality particularly the pillows which were very thin Everything about the room was a bit cheap We couldn t open our window either We got this room on a deal but if we had paid full price I think we would have asked for a partial refund really not up to standard and definitely not 4 stars 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, My single room was very small and the TV didn t work so after unpacking all my suits etc had to change bedrooms On the first visit to the room my key card didn t work which meant going downstairs again with all my bags to get another one 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was adequate if not a little dated The TV reception was awful Worst of all was the proximity to the trade entrance of the Park Lane Hilton and the noise from 0530 onwards was unbearable The windows are not sufficient to dampen the acoustics Therefore I would be unlikely to select this hotel in future which is a shame because it has enormous potential 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Front facing room meant being woken up at 6am by the Hilton bins being emptied from the night before a lot of glass bottles etc 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The electrical plug sockets in my room were so close to the built in furniture that it was impossible to use them Probably just bad luck 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Heating in Room very old fashioned could not work it out
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Hotel pictures must be old as hotel looks battered It really is in desperate need of a refurb Expensive for the standard of bedroom accommodation Look around before choosing to stay here as it really is disappointing and not good representation of value for money Rooms are small bathrooms not full size General cleanliness poor I did not take my shoes off in bedroom as carpet was so dirty Had room not been just a crash pad then I would have complained Bedroom furnishings so dated and bashed looks like a run down B B Noisy too guests coming in at all times yes I know it s a hotel paper thin walls and located near lift Avoid Receptionist was not very inviting I must have interrupted her conversion with her colleague to check in Prepare for a short stroll to nearest tube When I requested a taxi at reception I was told to walk to the Hilton Hotel wish I d stayed at the Hilton Returned to hotel around midnight straight in past night manager who did not even look at me I could have been anyone going into lift Breakfast was busy and although looked ok selection all needed replenishing and had to keep asking the 2 waitresses who were so busy for items so I Would not stay here again or recommend Don t be mislead by the pictures Glad that I was solo as embarassed hotel was not my usual standards 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms need refurbishing as they are tired but the prices charged for central London is great value If you want to explore this is a great place to make your base
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Ordered breakfast in our room as my husband had a conference call Breakfast was stone cold No milk for the tea no butter for the toast Eventually a new breakfast came Not too much better Very poor 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bathroom was very small if the door opened the other way or something that would make it easier to manoeuvre around
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Had to wait 15 minutes to be checked in No receptionist Then was given a room where the lights didn t work and was next to a lift On my booking I had put a request for a room NOT next to the lift Rooms are tired and dated Bed very uncomfortable and room was very cold I have stayed here several times before and the only reason I come back is the location If I could find somewhere else I wouldn t come back Having said that the staff are friendly enough 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It would have been good to have some more beverages available in our room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Areas could definitely do with a refurb also rooms quite small 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Always seemed to be under staffed and everything took quiet a while Very friendly though when not busy 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, D cor a bit tired but they are going to sort this out in the near future 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The breakfast food service was very poor The hot food was cold the staff were untrained One waitress tried to insist that the water she was pouring was tea took some persuading that it wasn t brewed And the mousetrap on the floor was concerning 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The bedroom overlooked the front where the motorbikes park and people smoke and shout and yell and swear all night long We could not sleep a wink 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Breakfast took long to refill plugs are Rubbish aren t able to fit cable in due to its strange placing some staff were a bit sharp tongued
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No central heating in the room however an oil radiator was provided An extra blanket was provided too No double glazed windows either leaving the room fairly cold at times TV Screen picture wasn t clear 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Generally the Hotel is a little tired but I feel it s still good value Busy breakfast room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Not the Hotel s fault but noisy neighbours kept us up until about 4 am On complaining staff knew about it but the feeling I got was tough I would use it again but with little sleep it s difficult to give comfort a good score 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Outside of the hotel is beautiful but found the interior quite dated and small BUT having said that for the money you really coulndt want more it was clean with nice staff 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Downstairs dirty staircase and paintwork to Toilet facilities Noises when bins emptied Sofas in lounge needed cleaning 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room window was bolted shut Having to pay 4 for a small bottle of still water No safe Room generally in need of touching up I ve stayed in nicer rooms at this hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room service breakfast was appalling It was cold when it came to my room had several items missing was was never worth the cost or the tray charge Never eating there again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The interior of our room was a little tired and probably needs a refurbish but it had everything we needed Bin men woke us up at 5 30am on Sunday morning which really was not appreciated 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, A bit dated and faded in places but nothing you would not expect and nothing to put you off staying here 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Room was quite small and a little cold
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Although the hotel conveniently located it s rooms are small Both bath and shower are one thing Table space for work is not sufficient for a business traveller Staff not friendly I will not be returning to the hotel 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms at the front look onto the service area of the Park Lane Hilton there s noise in the morning from refuse collections etc Unless you re getting up early ask for a room at the back 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms could use updating some burns on tables peeling woodwork old window blinds carpet etc Just don t look too closely

Park Lane Mews Hotel, This hotel is really tired and in need of refurbishment Everywhere you look there are marks on the walls tired carpets and damaged wood work In my single room the heating did not work a small plug in rad was put in to compensate but this was not man enough for a winters night and I had to get extra bedding My room had the following faults Curtains hanging off the track did not close window screwed shut and no way to get any fresh air bathroom had stray hairs behind the door and on the bath the underside of the taps has brown scale build up the soap tray was corroded the spy hole in the door was blocked up with loo roll the bath panel was bubbled from water damage the walls had marks and there was no BBC channels only news 24 
Park Lane Mews Hotel,No Negative
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The central heating is obviously not working a smallish radiator in the room which just about took the chill off Actually I like a cool bedroom so not a big problem No hot water on arrival 5 p m or that evening Television very badly pixillated Engineer came said problem with aerial Breakfast chaotic too many people at once The dining room is not big enough for the number of rooms Bathroom showing signs of wear and tear but there is a small bath always most welcome as alternative to shower 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, 1 aggressive interrogation by staff on our return from the ballet on Friday night including an insistence of taking our key and checking it in their reader 2 a 15 min queue for breakfast clearly no thought given to guests and their needs
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Electric radiator in room felt cheap and possibly dangerous 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff argued with me over something minor Very poor customer service Rooms and d cor was extremely shabby and outdated I felt it disrespectful and shameful that Genting Casino UK that owns this property was quick enough to take clients money but put no effort into making the rooms look any better than a poor 2 Star Staff need training in customer service The price of the room is not that much cheaper than the Marriott in Grosvenor Square where I stayed the remaining nights of my trip Park Lane Mews SHAMEFUL
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room whilst being clean was very worn and not up to a basic standard
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Sloppy cleaning in the rooms Had to ask them to Hoover again wash mugs for inroom tea making Deluxe rooms are too small to fit king size bed There is no room to walk around the bed without bumping into your partner sharing the room 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The dirty sock on the floor when I arrived The size of the bed which was tiny for tow people The thin duffet in December which meant I was up all night freezing
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It has been my worst hotel experience ever I have never been so dissapointet the hotel is rated as a four Star hotel and as a luxury hotel but it was so BAD ucly carpets the tapestry was dirty and broken old and very bad mattresses the TV did not work the toilet couldn t flush out One duble room ordinary Price 1650 for three nights I thought I got a very good offer 554 but it was a horrible Price for what we got Behind the hotel is a Managergroup but who are they Selling these rooms at these prices is robbery 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The hotel is very tired and needs a face lift Some areas were dirty but not daily dirt hence the comment about the need for a facelift The bathroom was clean generally but again in need of attention and refurb Would not recommend the breakfast It was dry due to being a buffet and food left over heat 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Woken up at 1 2 3 4 am with Xmas party goers returning Understand that this is not the hotel s direct fault but for me it didnt provide the basic ability to get a night sleep some better separation noise abatement might have helped 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, It wasn t that I didn t like anything in particular but I thought my room was adequate at best for the price I paid I was certainly not going to pay 16 plus for breakfast so checked out early and had breakfast elsewhere

Park Lane Mews Hotel, Plug sockets so close to floor unable to get a plug into them So not able to charge phone laptop

Park Lane Mews Hotel, This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in It is in an alley behind the Hilton and there is 24 hour noise of garbage collection staff on smoking breaks and limo drivers hanging around talking Windows offer no insulation Walls between rooms are paper thin and nonstop sound of doors slamming We had specifically asked for a quiet room so heaven help anyone who had a noisy room Worst night s sleep I can remember in short 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, my tv wouldn t show a picture it was 9 0 pm on Sunday night reception staff came the look at it but nothing could be done until the next morning however when i was checking out the staff must have known but nothing was said and to be honest for the price i paid i didn t push it

Park Lane Mews Hotel, I would not stay here Our room was so small you could not swing a cat in it There was no space to put our bags and as the bed was pushed against the wall I had to climb over the furniture to get to it The room was designed for a disabled person but there is no way a disabled person would have been able to move in this room or manage a wheelchair or walking frame in the bathroom We had to pay an extra 25 pounds for an upgrade

Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was tired and in need of updating Breakfast was poor with only one member of staff attending where food and plates ran out No handsoap in the room and at 239 per night excluding breakfast it was poor value for money 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Very very unhelpful rude staff one lady and a man During the check in two visitors in front of us were treated badly without any respect Not very well to us either even though they know that we are British couple Next morning whilst waiting for check out they were found to be unhelpful to another visitor who was waiting for breakfast a long time The breakfast was a joke We will never stay there again Very expensive to stay even in London standard The worn out room was just enough for the double bed We almost have to dive into the bed

Park Lane Mews Hotel, Rooms were in a shabby and very run down state Beds were basic and bathroom barely adequate This hotel has plummeted in standard in the last 15 years When we stayed here last it was the Hilton Mews and it was a very high standard small hotel Small is fine when quality is good The breakfast was most disappointing a very basic one star buffet with poor quality food When I last stayed here a very high quality English breakfast was served from the kitchen I don t mind a buffet if it is a high standard but this was rubbish 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room was a bit run down and a c heating unit seemed to broken This was replaced by a boxy portable unit which took up a lot of the room Room didn t have much in terms of a view and there were few amenities no mini bar no water no complimentary breakfast nobody offered to take up my luggage And after a 12 hour trip I stood at the front desk for several minutes before anyone even made eye contact or welcomed me Room decor and furniture needs to be upgraded 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Bedroom Hair in sink plug hole Peanuts under bed plain to see beds had never been pulled out and cleaned Found socks in cupboard Staff did not care a bit asked them to clean room when we went out but never did it Maid knocking on door telling us to check out early so she could clean The room Breakfast a joke took 10 mins to get bacon and sas by that time we had eaten Dont go there 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I arrived after a long journey keen to get into my room No one at all on duty in reception The restaurant manager did phone for someone but no one responded and I was left hanging around for over 20 minutes until the receptionist finally arrived No apology for keeping me waiting just he was dealing with a guest Clearly they do not have sufficient staff on duty if they leave reception every time a guest needs something After this bad start I spent a comfortable night and the girl on reception in the morning was far more pleasant The evening staff let the place down 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No way to change cash in local currency the taxi reservation done with a very expansive limuosine not with normal taxi

Park Lane Mews Hotel, The TV set was old and failed to tune to most of its channels The room decor is looking tired and overdue for refurbishment I would prefer a walk in shower to the over the bath type provided 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, There was not a safe in our room Our TV didn t work which was only annoying when we wanted to watch the news a couple of times Our toilet sometimes didn t flush Usually these things would really bother me about the property but the hotel is charming clean and in a good location so I can forgive them 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, everything is old no hot water bad wifi the whole hotel is old and in very bad condition this is cant be a 4 star hotel should be 2 star
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Poorly fitted out and shabby rooms The rooms I booked were heavily discounted evidently because I am a genius booker I have a feeling that these rooms are always at a discount so booking com are being disingenuous The full room tariff was 375 for a double for which I paid 144 I can t believe the room we stayed in was worth 375 at any time 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, I felt that the service was perfunctory at best The barman was unwelcoming the champagne was flat and I had to ask to get the usual crisps or olives with the glass of champagne I ordered continental breakfast which cost 17 with a 7 50 room service charge I m used to spending that for a good hotel s breakfast but it was poor One patty of Flora rather than butter and grapefruit juice made from concentrate For a Hilton Hotel on Park Lane albeit the Mews Property rather than the major hotel that is damned poor I would not stay there again An American tourist or any other tourist to the hotel would be very disappointed I also felt that had I been a man in a suit in the bar ordering champagne that the service would have been better 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, The room keys for the entire hotel sometime work and other times they don t This caused the entire clientele to wAit at the front desk until the staff could get it fixed They tried very hard
Park Lane Mews Hotel, No wifi within the room area moreover no enough space for bags nor for our clothes in closet further more if u don t leave your room before 1300 hrs you receive calls from reception as well as knocking door from house keeping for room cleaning and that was annoying If u have a medication needs to be kept in the fridger u have to use the hotel one beside there was no safe for your personal belonging 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Can t complain really I guess the only complaint would be that the rooms are quite small but you expect a basic room when paying these prices for such an affluent area of London 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Staff attitude Dirty Room smelling of cigarettes dirty curtains We found glasses that previous people have left asked if we could change rooms which they did however that room was even worse When we mentioned that on our departure receptionist answered Don t worry we are closing down Would never stay there again 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN UPGRADED BUT WAS TIRED AND SMALL NO HOT WATER FOR SHOWER OR BATH DID REPORT THIS ON LEAVING
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Where do we start The fact that the toilet did not work we reported this and when out for the evening to find that when we got back the toilet was still the same Offered a double room check it out to find that this room on the ground floor was like a drive through with the traffic outside only room left was a twin but even this toilet was bordering on the not working The noise outside into the wee small hours didn t help so got a could of hrs sleep For 120 for the night and the lack of comfort it was a bit much It would have been nice to have been offered a discount but this was not forth comming We don t complain but we feel we have to for other customers looking at this hotel It was nice to get home for a good nights sleep 
Park Lane Mews Hotel, At 9am in the morning the maid was knocking at the door then entered eager to clean the room As we left at 9 30am she was hanging around waiting for us to go Felt rushed to vacate the room

Park Lane Mews Hotel, Decor starting to look tired
Park Lane Mews Hotel, Cost for what was on offer
Henry VIII, The pool was of limits as was being cleaned which was a shame couldn t park outside the property we went in to book in came outside already there was a parking attendant by my car air con in room didn t seem to be working
Henry VIII, Couldn t get wifi with the code provided more fresh fruit selection and dried fruit at breakfast would be good for gluten free sufferers and porridge 
Henry VIII, The only down side was the air con was broken and we wasn t told about it 
Henry VIII, Bathroom was disgusting and shower did not work Hotel in need of complete renovation and the pictures on booking com are nothing like what the hotel is actually like 
Henry VIII, Hotel was very drab Room was supposed to be a double and should never have been anything but a single room Not good value for money Would not go back even if offered a free room 
Henry VIII, There is no aircon in the room Although I double checked and it was actually not specified in the room facilities you would expect it in a 4 star expensive hotel The room was really tiny and without room for two luggages Breakfast was dreadful and I ve eaten it just to feel full for the day but not because I enjoyed it The swimming pool and sauna were the reasons I chose the hotel instead of other options but don t get in this trap the facilities are very very basic sauna very tiny and if you can find another hotel with bigger rooms and nicer breakfast go for it and forget about this hotel 
Henry VIII, I couldn t get WiFi in my room and when asked reception about it I was handed a password code that should of been given to me when I booked in as standard The cleaner was cleaning the pool area from the day before whilst my child and I were in the pool at 7 15 Had to tell a fellow guest to shower off before getting in Should be more notices up maybe in the rooms 
Henry VIII, Tiny tiny rooms need tobe updated was missinformed about the breakfast times and booked train tickets accordingly was told breakfast starts at 07 00 asked the receptionist upon arrival when in fact in weekend it starts at 07 30 
Henry VIII, The decor is a little dated and the sauna could be bigger but that s really the worst thing I can say it s a great place 
Henry VIII, Reception service was friendly but incredibly and frustratingly slow Decor very old fashioned and basic rooms Breakfast poor quality inedible eggs and hot drinks from a row of push button machines
Henry VIII, The coffee machine only giving part measures and the television remote did not work It appears it was the wrong one It took quite a while to sort 
Henry VIII, This is no way a 4 star hotel rooms are very small Carpets in hotel need to be replaced especially floor 5 very dirty No air con working Bar had only I white or 1 red spanish wine no sparkling rose or other country Very poor bathrooms no storage or shelf for toiletries Large crack across our sink 
Henry VIII, They froze the 120 cost for the room on the date of booking even though Booking com state no prepayment required When my daughter clerked in they demanded payment from her I called and spoke to two lovely but discussion was difficult as neither appeared to understand me I have a very mild NZ accent often confused as English They are continuing to hold the 120 payment though the stay ended yesterday I want Booking com to look into this matter
Henry VIII, Breakfast was terrible The cook needs a good talking to All the pastries were burnt and the eggs powdered and tasteless and the mushrooms stewed with no flavour One male staff member strutted around with his sleeves rolled up so high on his arms for the purpose of showing his tattoos Very tacky The female staff in the dining room looked very unenthused and stood around talking 
Henry VIII, Booked a double bed room and ended up with twin beds went back to reception to be told there was no other rooms then they found us a double room which was horrible right next to the train line and big generators as a view The room felt more like an hostel than a hotel room Back to the reception we went demanding a refund but then we were offered the best room in the hotel a suite for 1 night which we accepted but had to change in the morning We was then moved to a double room which was adequate for 1 night The pool was also closed due to maintenance one of the reasons we decided to stay here for It felt like just because we found a great deal we were put in the worst rooms 170 is not just pocket money will not be returning to this hotel 
Henry VIII, The room was not big enough and not adequate for two people There was no room to go around the bed so that I had to get over my partner to reach the bathroom The A C was down so that we have been sweating the whole night Bathroom was extremely small There was no minibar I had to purchase 6 x mini bottles of water form reception not to die of thirst 1 3 of a liter each at the cost of GBP 7 5 The safe box was down as well Overall a complete disaster I will not recommend the stay at this hotel to anyone I will never go there again 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, The room was too small we could hardly move around in it It was hot no air conditioning with only a desk fan The ceiling fan was not working This is not anywhere near a 4 star hotel There was no manager on duty wee had to move to a livable place after only one night 
Henry VIII, The majority of the staff needed to smile and realise that they are paid to serve and look after their customers Chairs and tables for breakfast were dirty Pool sauna were ridiculously small Scrambled egg at breakfast was dry beyond all belief Room was too small for 2 people we spent 4 nights falling over our suitcases I had to laugh when my husband asked for an ironing board it filled the room Painting decorating including sanding happening right outside our bedroom at 8am paint smell noisy cleaners around the same time I think that s all
Henry VIII, BASIC ROOM IS TOO SMALL FOR 2 ADULTS
Henry VIII, I m wondering how this hotel is rated 4 stars Rooms are very small Very average breakfast I paid the full stay in cash They removed the first night and after 17 days I still didn t get my money back Every time i ask them they said that they contacted their bank and refund will come soon Be sure to get a room with ceiling fan and AC because when the AC stop working they say that AC is not included in the booking Not very close to any underground station
Henry VIII, I pretty much disliked everything about the hotel It was old tired and worn The rooms were tiny and outdated Everything seemed done on the cheap from the smallest bottles of shower gel to the low quality pillows 
Henry VIII, The staff here ruined my experience in London completely They were rude dismissive and didn t care for customer service whatsoever Our shower had no running water so I called reception and they said maintenance would be there within an hour 2 hours later and they still didn t call me back So I went to the lobby and asked what was going on because I needed to shower and leave the hotel for my flight and the lady at reception hadn t even called maintenance I asked if they could just give me another room I could shower in and she said she would ask and let me know within 10 minutes I waited in my room for another hour and she never got back to me Eventually my friends and I couldn t wait any longer because we would ve missed our flight so we did not shower and checked out and left When I came to check out the lady at reception asked so did u find a solution to the shower situation And I had no idea how to respond because not only did they not care to call maintenance but they couldn t even give me another room or even call me back to let me know what was going on The staff here are definitely incompetent and I would not recommend staying here unless it s only for a quick one night stay 
Henry VIII, Very Hot weekend Air con unit in room but told that air con wasn t something they offered Windows locked so had to wait until maintenance were able to unlock windows Hotel provided a fan so room was Ok with fan and windows open 
Henry VIII, Room was tiny how they got a double bed and by double I am being generous in the room defies logic there wasn t enough room to open a suitcas on the floor Air con didn t work this room should barely pass as a single 
Henry VIII, Despite there being air cons in every room they had been disabled and with the blistering heat last week they declined to switch them on for anyone I did see people checking out for that reason I had a fan in my room and on checking the fine detail of my booking they did not actually claim they air conditioning You might be forgiven for assuming as I did that at this price that would come as standard My room was somewhat bijou and the bathroom was very tiny with room for one person only The Wi Fi was very slow not really acceptable in 2017 
Henry VIII, The worst hotel I have ever stayed at I came back to our room at night and found other people in my room The staff were so unorganised it was incredible Rooms are horrible and the second room they gave me seemed to be next to the train or tube tracks Impossible to sleep 
Henry VIII, The Breakfast was ok but the scrambled eggs tasted like egg powder I travelled with a vegan and while everyone else was well catered for vegans are not the communal areas of the hotel are a bit scruffy and dated
Henry VIII, Toiletries and drink provision a little on the mean side The soap did not lather at all No biscuits or hot chocolate etc For this price I would expect a little more home comfort and more of a welcome 
Henry VIII, I fail to see how this is a 4 hotel The room was cramped big cracks in the sick carpets stained and shredded Chairs in the dining room were stained and dirty Whilst there we were also not advised that construction work would be starting in the next room at 8am Monday morning which we were not pleased with All in all this was a complete nightmare stay and frankly not worth the money we paid We will not be staying here again Absolutely shocking hotel 
Henry VIII, Better explanation from staff on reception re pool and facilities 
Henry VIII, Our twin room was of an adequate size for a one night stay but we found the bathroom really compact but saying that it was clean and functional 
Henry VIII, I booked a basic double and got a 7 2 sqm dirty stinking prison cabinet broken bed could only be entered by crawling over the foot end Unsafe exit automatic doors didn t open 25 minutes for check in When I returned to ask for the double room as booked they just said take it or leave it but you will have to pay anyway Ergo Do not go there fraud and unsafe 
Henry VIII, First way too small room especially after what they charge Secondly AC doesn t work Third Receptionists are the worst that I have seen in my life Fourth No room service So even if u want a spoon u have to go and get from reception
Henry VIII, The single room was so tiny that I had no place to store my suitcase The small cupboard could barely fit anything The air conditioning is non functional in every room I overheard other guests is mostly for show The free breakfast was mediocre 
Henry VIII, The air conditioning was broke and didn t fall under the responsibility of the staff so they simply switched on the overhead fan The beds were on wheels so every time I moved during the night my bed skid across the wood flooring The location is a bit of a step outside the centre but there are good links to all public transport also 
Henry VIII, The room was a single room sold as a double There was not room for us to both walk in it More suitable for backpackers Hugely over priced and not work the money at all Overall hotel is tired but the room has to be the worse I have ever stay I didn t even bother to stay for breakfast 
Henry VIII, People coming into your room without knocking Loud banging doors Breakfast buffet was poor over cooked and luke warm Room was more like a cell 
Henry VIII, Staff was unservers unfortunately This hotel wasn t 4 stars Perhaps between 2 3 
Henry VIII, My partner got food poisoning from the breakfast has been violently sick ever since I m absolutely devastated 
Henry VIII, Squeaky floors no air conditioning
Henry VIII, Nothing it was perfect
Henry VIII, I found the whole experience very deflating The hotel smells very old and I would give it a 1 or maximum 2 star rating The carpet is worn away and the furniture and upholstery is all extremely old The place smells old The receptionist could not understand anything I was saying 
Henry VIII, air conditioning didn t work only a few channels on TV no itv or channel 4 When complained told that we had a ceiling fan and that the air conditioning didn t work in the whole hotel I rather think it was on a timer so it didn t work to save money This was billed as a four star hotel and it certainly wasn t and the price reduction was from 340 a night I paid 89 for a twin room which was not a price reduction I think that was what it was worth
Henry VIII, They put us up in the smallest room we could tell by the fire map on the wall which was tiny and a bit challenging for two adults to maneuver around in the mornings The aircon in the room was taped in the middle and would only stay on for a few seconds before shutting itself off We could of course have complained but we were only there for two nights and had already unpacked so it was a bit of an inconvenience 
Henry VIII, I booked a double but was put in a twin when I asked to be moved I was told the room size is the same I explained I would like a double bed so was moved Air con is in the rooms but doesn t work although an electric fan was supplied However it was during the heatwave so it just wasn t enough so I slept badly due to the heat Restaurant only serves breakfast there s lots of places for food nearby though but not ideal if like me you re uncomfortable eating out alone Swimming pool changing rooms are just a hanging curtain next to the pool 
Henry VIII, You are paying more than 100 bucks per night and you don t even get air conditioner inside your tiny room I complained it and the receptionist gave me very old small fan and recommended me to use another fan on the ceiling But it was very noisy to turn on all night Single bad is extremely narrow If you weigh more than 70 kg your body will be bigger then mattress Swimming pool is also very small it fits only for 2 people swimming at same time 
Henry VIII, The room was tiny Two people could not comfortably stand up in the room and our small carry on suitcases did not fit in the room 
Henry VIII, Air conditioning was broken on the hottest days of this summer and staff were not concerned about getting it fixed Beds uncomfortable and pillows useless Pool was ok but sauna tiny 2 people maximum No showers or adequate changing areas The photos were clearly photoshopped
Henry VIII, Price value total rip off Very old and unconvenient facilities mainly shower Staff was unfriendly and not professionnal at all No A C couldnt sleep whole night
Henry VIII, Start to finish everything a room where you have a metre of floor space air con units fitted but hotel policy isnt to switch them on food was aweful 2 3 of the staff there didnt care less you so that in their customer service what made it worse is i travelled with my 5 year old and even she said it was bad Looks a lovely hotel from the outside but needs a complete transformation in my opinion 
Henry VIII, The front foyer looks terrible with patches of worn carpet It really brings the hotel down and you wonder why it is a 4 star The furniture in the foyer also worn and dated An overhaul of the main entrance would definitely be beneficial to first impressions 
Henry VIII, The room was tiny The breakfast was disgusting we had paid for breakfast for both mornings but didn t bother going for it the second morning The facilities in the room didn t work Not as described or advertised online 
Henry VIII, The hotel is generally in need of re decoration throughout The temperatures had raised and the rooms were quite hot and it was a shame that the AC was not working particularly in the triple room 
Henry VIII, the first bedroom had loud train noise so we moved second bedroom and bathroom was very small almost unbearable customer set up phone on Face time or equivalent in breakfast room and spoke very loudly in foreign language for over half an hour could be heard through out the room and was not approached by staff Staff spoke very poor English three members of staff didn t know what a poached egg was when we asked for it bar is poorly stocked and staff not knowledgeable tried to tell us tonic water was the same as soda water
Henry VIII, This hotel looks the part from outside Just don t go in The room is more like you would expect in Claxton No offence to clacton The first room you could not swing the proverbial cat We moved to a bigger room and that smelt of stale cigarette smoke The 3rd and final room we looked at still shabby but stayed 1 night instead of 2 Do not boot this hotel Try the YMCA 
Henry VIII, Air conditioner and fan didn t work Room was so small we had to back up into tiny bathroom to pass each other
Henry VIII, it was a 10 15 min walk from Paddington station
Henry VIII, Shabby carpets cooked breakfast was Apoling
Henry VIII, Small room not working air conditioner stuff can t help us 
Henry VIII, We only chose this hotel for a business trip because they had a triple room available When we arrived we were eventually told that there was a problem with the room and that we would need to share a bed or have separate rooms on the same floor which for three women isn t ideal The hotel didn t attempt to contact me in advance of our arrival to let us know however after some discussion the issue was eventually resolved and we agreed to take a family room with a double and sofa bed which was adequate We also received a partial refund and the staff were apologetic so it wasn t a disaster 
Henry VIII, Everything see above
Henry VIII, Room was cramped and directly over rail tracks Trains passing all the time Floors boards in the room were very noisey Floor boards in the room next and above us were very noisy We could hear everything said next door to us Air con was broken There was a fan in the room but it just pushed around hot air Window had to be closed at night to drown out the noise of the trains Not a modern hotel Bed was clean and comfortable Bathroom was very small but clean and shower was good Good location but the room was not worth the price at all But that is what you get in London Room was ok if all you were there to do was sleep in it and get out early for the whole day Not a place for couples 
Henry VIII, i tried to call the hotel 4 weeks before travel on a saturday it was permanently engaged then i was left on hold and finally when i did get through i was told to hold the line ahd eventually put the phone down after waiting 30mins i mentioned this to a number of staff but they just said sorry the other thing is my night in london was 10th june and the hotel took the full amount the day after i booked it which i think was a bit harsh especially as every person who was checking in the following day i spent a number of afternoon hours in reception paid at the desk on the day 
Henry VIII, The air conditioning had an error meaning it wasnt working breakfast was very continental and lacked flavour orange juice was orange squash
Henry VIII, Very hot in the room air con not working fan in room did not help all three of us 
Henry VIII, The cleaning of the pool and sauna facilities
Henry VIII, Scruffy and dirty reception and corridors Very cramped room Aircon broken Ceiling fan broken TV remote broken Desk chair ripped No orange juice left at breakfast time Cheap food products at breakfast Undercooked breakfast items sausage absolutely no colour and cold to touch No staff service at checkout when we asked for a manager there wasn t one available 
Henry VIII, The very small room if you wanted to stay up next to the bed it was impossible 
Henry VIII, The bed was quite firm for us and the room size was very tight literally no room to move around and no place for suitcases Location of the hotel was a bit far away from most of the main attractions and we would have preferred to be more central as we were there as tourists Nearby restaurants were limited too 
Henry VIII, it is for sure not a four star hotel maybe two the room we had has no view it s very small for a double the pictures about the pool are photoshoped it looks much better than real in the photo cold water no minibar the remote control for the TV had no battery cover noisy shower because of an deffective regulator the filters in the A C were maybe never cleaned therefore the A C had a permanent error and was not working 
Henry VIII, Room was very small for two persons but clean and some parts of inventory have already reached the point to be replaced
Henry VIII, The staff were unhelpful The Air Conditioning was broken throughout the whole hotel The Bar shut at 11pm There was no room service The breakfast was poorly cooked and the quality was very poor and had run out of many items Service from the foreign staff with vey poor English was abysmal
Henry VIII, Room size was poor 10 for upgrade 
Henry VIII, The rooms are very small and although it s advertised as a double room it s really a single room with a small double bed The air conditioning units did not work The whole hotel looks tired and is in need of refurbishment decoration 
Henry VIII, Bedroom was too small to walk around the bed properly Bar didn t open till 8pm Hotel ignored request for rooms to be close to each other
Henry VIII, Poor lift small room loads of noise from neighbouring rooms floor squeaking convos etc poor customer service at breakfast poor parking shocking door for the bathroom All in all really disappointed with this hotel which is allegedly 4 Worst booking I have made on this site 
Henry VIII, The carpet was a bit shabby in places and the breakfast selection was rather limited 
Henry VIII, I do nt know
Henry VIII, The sauna was not operating and the TV didn t work despite being reported early in the evening of our overnight stay 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Nothing to none about
Henry VIII, Didn t feel like i was in London felt like I was in Spain Spanish staff guests 2 languages on everything Wasn t expected Wasn t the cleanest Needs a refurbishment Room was tiny breakfast was not great either Probably wouldn t go back 
Henry VIII, The room was just too small to put me and the suitcase in I could only open my door half way when putting my suitcase The air condition was not working at all the fan they gave me was too loud to use for night time 
Henry VIII, The room was small Breakfast was stale and the eggs tasted like cardboard The room in where you ate breakfast smelt like mould
Henry VIII, Everything place is a hole 1 star maybe rooms are a broom closet
Henry VIII, The wifi is sporadic at best and the staff is non responsive to concerns 
Henry VIII, The room had an insect infestation It was extremely dusty and not very clean I certainly do not agree with the star ranking of this hotel My room was changed the next day as the manager was not available on the first day I did not get any apology and the cleaning unit did not attend The breakfast was certainly not vegetarian friendly The sausages are placed next to egg and other options and hotel visitors mix the utensils when serving themselves The staff had real difficulties in understanding my issues and never picked up the phone 
Henry VIII, Could do with new carpets and a lick of paint in the reception 
Henry VIII, The bedroom was very small and was only just a single not double as booked the bed was extremely uncomfortable and left no space to move around There was an issue with check in where the room we were booked into was not ready and so we were put into the small room I was asked for my passport which confused me as I am English The receptionist gave us the barest of information referring to a scrap of paper Trains were passing the room so could not have the window open due to excessive noise 
Henry VIII, We were very unhappy that the TV did not work only very loud radio and volume control not working No instructions on how to operate the TV in the room Reception informed and said they did not know how the TV worked and could not help with the problem until next morning but we only were there for one night so not a a lot of use They said they would ask someone and ring back they never did The Air Conditioning unit did not work when set it went to error it was a hot night Nice Area and Very good Buffet Breakfast
Henry VIII, Double bed is not 4 but 4 6 in briton furniture very tired with items not working i e air conditioning Room not ready on time 
Henry VIII, Everything Incompetent staff ridiculously small room for a big price there wasnt even space for our 2 bags miniature TV no fridge disgusting lobby scary elivators
Henry VIII, When we booked it was stated that there was parking facilities this was not the case we had to park at the thistle hotel around the corner which cost me 48 00 for 2 days We booked this hotel on the understanding it had parking facilities When I questioned the receptionist about this he said oh we have to get this taken off write up sorry there is nothing we can do the only parking facilities we have is at the front of the building on a meter which was impossible to book over the phone He wasn t bothered that we had driven up there on the understanding there was parking facilities for the hotel or that this cost me another 48 
Henry VIII, We were disappointed with our room which had no carpet felt like we were staying in a kitchen The bed was also very hard uncomfortable The breakfast was very basic bland Overall the hotel was very below what I expected by the reviews I had read before we booked it 
Henry VIII, Mostly industrial products for breakfast don t recommend it Decoration a bit older 
Henry VIII, The hotel was not clean did not smell clean either The room was so small and uncomfortable I could not sleep The bathroom was not cleaned properly Disgusting and disappointed
Henry VIII, Run down and not a quality hotel in my humble opinion Room was hot Broken air con with extra fan in the room Despite this on full blast it was still hot Very tired decor 
Henry VIII, The room was a little small but quite adequate as we weren t in it much We found it hard to find fault with anything else 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, It needs renovation furniture wise
Henry VIII, Whole hotel a little tired the cleaners hoovered the corridors at 07 30 and banged the hoover against our door The walls are very thin you can hear a lot from other rooms and the bathroom 
Henry VIII, The bedroom was like a box room Not much in complimentary washing items 
Henry VIII, Room very basic and small considering we had two single beds Windows not well insulated Looks a bit worn out overall although quite clean 
Henry VIII, Staff were very abrupt The room was not to the standard shown in the images and the air con didn t work bathroom wasnt 100 clean and the electrics looked dangerous 
Henry VIII, the size of room very small luckily only stayed a couple of nights so wernt to bad every floorboard creaked and we had to lay on bed and look to the left to watch tv as it was above dressing table and not on wall in front of us i think it needs a bit of a revamp
Henry VIII, Our room 210 was classed as basic double but was actually only the size of a small single room The bed was a large single and not wide enough to be considered a double bed The a con did not work fortunately not required for our one night stay Shower head partially blocked Breakfast was poor Coffee machines out of order and staff not coping 
Henry VIII, Room was next to the lift so did not sleep at all Very noisy hotel Not ideal for me and my 10 yr old daughter who had school the next day and sleepless night for her
Henry VIII, The noise maybe the workers outside
Henry VIII, Small sauna and the diet around the swimming pool on the mosaic tiles where the water splashes up the sides 
Henry VIII, The breakfast was not very nice Cheap sausage and the egg was a funny texture Coffee and tea was not very good at all The shower was very temperamental and difficult to turn on and off and keep at a steady temperature The plug didn t work in the room The wifi was awful and was supposed to last five days but had forgotten my device by the morning 
Henry VIII, Rooms were in need of repair Broken tiles on floor toilet seat was nearly off We had chocolates in the room that had been opened and were 1 2 eaten Rooms all smelled of smoke Lots of foreign men at night all laying on the sofas in reception Very off putting d
Henry VIII, Air con faulty in room and room too hot Shower temp was very difficult to get right Sound proofing terrible we were in 506 and may as well have been in a family room with the guests next door could hear EVERYTHING which wasnt good when sharing a room with my 11 year old son There was one lady on reception when we first arrived at the hotel who completely blanked us for several minutes whilst tapping into a computer She was clearly about to hand over and did not want to engage but a simple acknowledgement and a few words t o welcome us and reassure us that somebody would be with us shortly wouldnt have gone a miss Although clean the hotel is very tired and in desperate need of some money spending on ut 
Henry VIII, The rooms are really small for 4stars hotels the furniture is very used The pool needs renovation and perhaps poolbeds where u can stay and relax could be good idea 
Henry VIII, We had originally paid for a double room with a double bed and were given a twin room with two single beds pushed together We were then moved to a double room We queued at reception to wait for the receptionist to become avaliabe and she checked in the people behind us even though we had been stood waiting Communicating was slightly difficult on times as English wasn t the first language spoken by some of the receptionists 
Henry VIII, VERY DIRTY Dust and Stains MOLD everywhere Carpet even felt dirty walking on it with SHOES Shower full with MOLD Nothing as promised NO WIFI was working for 6 days I was told after asking for 4 times to dont be so so difficult and go sit in the hall with the others NO water pressure in the shower burbinh hot or ice cold water was the choice Sigarette smell through the whole hotel Rude personel I was laufged at when telling the reception that I wanted to swim The swimming pool was not available because of maintenance I was told to swim in the river nearby Bad breakfast NO working coffee machines 30 for an egg and some CANNED BEANS is not really my standard of a proper breakfast BAD Bed the springs came through the mattress VERY high price with NO value for money 
Henry VIII, The whole hotel needs to be modernized or the rates reduced much much more Our entire floor smelled of cigarette smoke we left after 1 night of our 3 night stay 
Henry VIII, The first night we were put in room 6 that had bad plumbing and very noisey from the reception area late at night we were moved to room up stairs 204 This room was much better in size and location until the second day in this room the toilet was leaking all over the floor the staff at reception and the maintenance man were soon to the room to rectify the problem in all we were happy with our stay but the hotel is of an age that requires and comprehensive overhaul 
Henry VIII, Only criticism was a rather loud noise generator boiler which went on for about a minute at just after 7am on our last day Luckily we were already awake otherwise that would of woken me up 
Henry VIII, the room too small and no view from a window the bed was uncomfortable the sink did not work that well and the elevator didn t work well
Henry VIII, The only thing I could fault this hotel over was the fact that the pool closes at 11 
Henry VIII, When making the booking i was given the opportunity of making a special request As i was travelling with my son i asked for a room with two separate single beds which we didn t get on arrival The staff at reception was not even aware of our request We insisted and got what we wanted the next day but not via your services I have had this three times now twice on a Nairobi booking where i asked for an airport transfer which was simply ignored Your system only talks about deals all day but should concentrate more on satisfying the client s needs In this case the hotel did dispose of rooms with twin beds and could easily have accommodated our request from day 1 In fact your system sucks as you are not giving the client 100 priority in satisfying his specific needs 
Henry VIII, The breakfast especially the eggs were awful The air conditioner didn t work because it was apparently only ever turned on in the summer The room was the smallest double I have ever had the misfortune to experience 
Henry VIII, The Deluxe Double room was smaller than expected short of drawer cupboard space for a 4 night stay and would benefit from a having a fridge There was free wifi but it was very slow The window looked out on to some inner space so no view at all 
Henry VIII, Very poor service Waste of my valuable money for the price I paid to stay in for 5days Very dissatisfied with the staff and cleanliness of the hotel Quality of service was very poor 
Henry VIII, I paid for a double bed but had a small single room really small
Henry VIII, I had noisy neighbours in my room one night but no big deal 
Henry VIII, The room was not the one advertised on booking com When we complained to reception about this they did nothing Our room was right next to the underground train track and the noise levels was awful this also was not mentioned in the booking com ad again the staff on reception did nothing about getting us another room Some of the staff had poor English and knew nothing about local area We spent 4 weeks in Europe staying at all sorts of hotels and this one was by far the worst we had come across 
Henry VIII, The recepTionist wanted us to park in An expensive Public car park Cause They were not informed that there is Free parking After 1 30pm saturday and on Sunday Rooms are Super Tiny and The train Noise If So Mear As If He Would cross The Room
Henry VIII, Took a while for the initial receptionist to understand that just offering to cancel the booking when I had nowhere else to stay was not really a satisfactory solution 
Henry VIII, The room was too small The hotel needs renovation Our room was next to the underground line which was pretty noisy Thin walls didn t help with the noise either 
Henry VIII, In the evening I have noticed there was no water from the tap First of all when it happened I was not informed about it and when I rang the reception they kept telling me to wait for half an hour as their maintenance team is already working on it for 2 hours After 2 hours of not being able to use the toilet I finally went down to the reception and complaind about it and the receptionist told me that she can only do and say what she was told to I get that but that should not be the response First she should have apolosiged about the inconvenience Any way I was offered another room The following morning when we checked out again there was no apology what so ever I know this is not a 5 star hotel but there is no harm in having 5 star service It doesn t cost any extra money but the effect can be surmounting 
Henry VIII, When I arrived at the property I had no running water in the room called reception and they said they would get maintenance to look at it Subsequently went out for the night and came back around 10 30pm still no water The receptionist was very apologetic and found me another room happen to be a Suite within 30 minutes 
Henry VIII, The room was rather disappointing for a 4 We didn t have any cold water in the evening so couldn t have a shower as it was scalding We were told that the water tank was empty but it would be OK for the morning 
Henry VIII, See above
Henry VIII, The over all feel of the hotel Not good dated and falling apart and rooms really small and pokie Over priced Travelodge would of been better 
Henry VIII, Tired worn carpets in hallways Swimming pool was good but the tiles could do with cleaning as there was a dirty rim mark the whole way around the pool but over all it would be fair to say it was clean enough 
Henry VIII, Cold air got into the room throuw windows Heating could not do its work like that Those windows should be properly isolated
Henry VIII, This hotel is in need of a major refurbishment and I hope they have it booked in the calendar soon The carpets were worn stained badly and in some places stuck down with tape and this was just in the main reception area The paint was coming off the walls Breakfast wasn t really anything to shout about either 20 limited selection but the hot English breakfast was limited to bacon that had been there all morning scrambled eggs that were not worth eating and I wont even mention the sausages This hotel could be amazing but the simple things are letting it down Needs attention rapidly 
Henry VIII, Pretty small hall not that clean bathroom too tiny difficult to regulate water s temperature and bathroom not that lighted 
Henry VIII, Only drawback is lack of parking but this is central London 
Henry VIII, The lifts seemed abit temperamental went up and down a couple of times when we reached floor 1 so I recommend using the stairs Also in the morning water started coming through the coving above the bath and toilet to find out this was the person above us having a shower So I didn t use our shower purely because I didn t feel safe enough with risk of how safe is the ceiling Reception did call maintenance who confirmed upstairs was using the shower and they did offer another room for me to shower in but by then we had to leave so I wouldn t of had time to 
Henry VIII, Booked a double room Got 4 singles The carpet was up in places and shabby i e The reception the room the 5th floor corridor The room itself was too hot There was a fan and an air conditioner in the room Neither worked The window door would not open to let some air in I was awake from 4am I went downstairs to get water and had to pay a fiver for a bottle of water 4 pound for the bottle but the night porter had no access to change I never got back to sleep Please do not describe this hotel as 4 stars I was in room 507 with a locked access door to the room next to me which meant I heard their conversations and arguements till 1am I never visited the bar pool or had breakfast so I cannot comment on them
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, The room was quite small Clumps of dust and hair on the rooms floor Massive food looking smear across the mirror 
Henry VIII, Bedroom was small and next to the underground track when we arrived the room was freezing we expected the heater to already be on at a comfortable temperature not a cozy welcome 
Henry VIII, the water flow in the shower was not strong enough but it is really a small thing
Henry VIII, Wifi didn t work most of the time or was very slow Our bathroom door was broken where clearly had been a leak and they fixed themselves The spa was nice but when we checked in no information was given if you just went there or needed towels etc 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Single room next to lift shaft no sleep at all Needed to get up early to go to a meeting so went to bed early TV has very limited channels lots of babe stations 
Henry VIII, It was cold in the room The rubbish hadn t been removed from previous occupants It was overall a bit tatty and could do with some refurbishment 
Henry VIII, Slightly ageing carpets and light switches could be cleaner 
Henry VIII, Air conditioner and shower didn t work The fan that was supplied was too noisy to leave on all night Opening the window resulted in the door banging all night Also the wind coming through went into the bathroom and made the bath panel moving that made the noise of a small dog barking all night Staff and hotel very good But had virtually no sleep in two nights
Henry VIII, Basically no room service tried calling three times in one night no answer Went down stairs for two glasses of wine had to wait for someone to come to the so called bar Glasses were filthy Got charged more than it said when I booked it would definetly not recommend 
Henry VIII, Room too small TV didn t work Air con didn t work Room too hot Very noisy Staff refused to give any discount on my room after complaint Could only give me 25 off a future stay I will not be staying again 
Henry VIII, The decor a little tired Pillows were dreadful Had a cracked sink and bath panel but all worked Shower was okish but did the job for a cheap stay 
Henry VIII, Room far too hot with air con not working and impossible to turn down radiator Found quality of experience poor for 120 Very noisey outside with people walking about and shouting Had to have window open and on ground floor Corridor areas and rooms very tatty and unappealing Carpet wearing away etc Staff vacuuming outside the door directly banging it into the door at 8am Sunday morning Also staffs Todd outside door talking loudly on he radio 
Henry VIII, Asked for a room with a view Could have been any view and I wouldn t have known Windows were extremely filthy and couldn t see a thing Iron or trouser press didn t work Heating refused to work Tv had no reception and the shower was terrible Seen more water from a light rain shower Lift was like something out of the twilight zone and terrified my wife Overall it was an over exaggerated luxury hotel 
Henry VIII, The room s were very very small the picture s were not accurate at all The hotel bar had a very poor selection of drinks 
Henry VIII, Shower head was partially broken so the water flow was pretty poor Also their was a stain on the duvet 
Henry VIII, Much of the breakfast did not include gluten free options e g cereal was all wheat based It would help if potato products were labelled as GF or not
Henry VIII, Awful breakfast Swimming in fat So I had toast instead Sausages looked half cooked Waited for more to be served out waited 15mins and gave up Bathroom was grubby room was like a bedsit stains on the bed worn tired and in need of restoration didn t feel comfortable and wanted to go home Tiles were loose in the bathroom hairs hanging down in there Mold and try to find the toilet flush is a mystery side mounted How odd 
Henry VIII, Very small room Very small bed Very old carpets bathroom and furnitures The water when you shower takes a long time to go down the drains Needs a renovation asap 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Wooden floors meant noise could be heard from other guests above unfortunately we had a school trip above so we didn t get much sleep The staff were very good and we did move to a room without double glazing so the next night was spent listening to the traffic and noise from outside 
Henry VIII, Air Conditioning didn t work so had to open the windows which meant the room stunk of chargrilled meat from the Greek restaurant Asked at reception and was told none of the AC was working as it d been turned off for winter Shower head only worked on a fixed central jet and couldn t be changed to a shower type spray There was litter on the floor from a previous guest Generally a bit unclean Hotel reception carpet the first customer impression was awful worn out patched and loose 
Henry VIII, Room was a lot smaller than pictured Interior of rooms and hotel were dated The noise from outside the room was very loud from early on in the morning Noise from passing cars was quite loud 
Henry VIII, Dirty rim around the pool shower was hopeless very small TV made watching it difficult as had to swing the glass Reception weren t very welcoming they were polite but just off
Henry VIII, All great 
Henry VIII, Orange juice and bacon both tasted horrible Eggs were dry Bed was too firm 
Henry VIII, The room was tiny just enough room for the bed and toilet Couldn t sleep well for the sound of trains Toilet door didn t close Asked for a room upgrade which we would pay for but was told the hotel was fully booked Air conditioning unit had lights flashing on it so the room was like a disco at night 
Henry VIII, I chose to pay when I arrive however a deposit of 90pounds 101euro came out of my account a few days before I arrived I paid cash when checking in with the knowledge that the deposit would be refunded into my account in 5 7 working days It has now been 9 working days and I have not received my money back and I inconveniently have to make expensive international calls in order to follow up on it 
Henry VIII, would have liked a softer mattress no shampoo conditioner had to ask on reception no drinking water in room all minor things
Henry VIII, Maybe the staff of the reception they weren t very kind and helpful but they knew do their work
Henry VIII, Shower was broke and had to get someone to sort it The pool was lovely and warm however The changing facilities were a joke there were only two changing cubicles at the side of the pool with no lockers There was nowhere to leave your belongings The shower was freezing cold and the sauna was not working 
Henry VIII, The hotel seemed understaffed in reception and tired in appearance with some little things needing attention e g the air conditioner unit in our room made noises in the night even though it was switched off the bathroom door was water damaged the flooring was warped the bath chipped and in general the decor looked tired and a little old fashioned 
Henry VIII, Decor could be updated but to be fair basic room booked and that is what it was 
Henry VIII, photos and description of the hotel were not accurate There were many repairs to be made in the bathroom And over all the hotel was not the 4 star accommodation it claimed to be 
Henry VIII, The bedroom was small but it is perfect for the likes of us tourists who are out all day sight seeing 
Henry VIII, The room was a bit poky but it was only a base so it didn t matter 
Henry VIII, The bar and restaurant was advertised but didn t seem to open Room was advertised as small but it was tiny barely room to move and there wasn t anywhere to put my case 
Henry VIII, It would be nice if the bar opened a little earlier in the evening as it would be nice to have a drink before going out 
Henry VIII, The hotel supposedly has 4 stars That might have been true 20 years ago but not anymore The interior is very dated and it s not as clean as I hoped I chose this hotel because it was cheap and it had parking It turns out that the parking is just on the road and there s no guarantee you ll find a spot When you do you have to pay around 65 to be standing there an entire day 
Henry VIII, D cor not very good Rooms and corridors smelt of smoke Bedroom very small virtually nothing worked properly i e Air con heating kettle television pixilated bathroom panels broken restaurant closed apart from breakfast and coffee tea machines wasn t working
Henry VIII, The fittings carpets decoration all need refurb Breakfast offered everything but all low standard There was absolutely no attention to detail 
Henry VIII, Room was tiny we couldn t leave the luggage open and be in the room at the same time also the a c was broken and lighted annoyingly all night when we asked to move to another room the staff member told us that the a c problem exsist in all rooms so we need to stay in our room 
Henry VIII, The coffee machine was spluttery and took a long time to work Wasn t too impressed by it 
Henry VIII, Bed extremely uncomfortable pillows terrible Ordered a wakeup call for flight Never happened even though I rang to double check they had the request Carpet old and shabby Cold in the restaurant 
Henry VIII, Wifi was really slow and tv channels were all over the place room was small but manageable
Henry VIII, I found my room to be tidy but didn t feel it was the cleanest and the hotel could certainly do with a little updating For the cost my stay was pleasant enough I certainly wouldn t have wanted to pay anymore for this room though 
Henry VIII, That I wasn t aloud to have the breakfast I paid for on arrival and now I cant get my money back The staff could work out with in them selfs that my breakfast was paid and refused me Refund is denied Don t want to stay at any other of their hotels ever Thank you
Henry VIII, There was just some dust under the bed I dropped something and it went under the bed But it was nothing major All in all we had a fantastic stay 
Henry VIII, Our only dislike is the shower the pressure and temperature are both wonderful but there isn t a curtain there s a little plastic wall so it didn t keep much heat in 
Henry VIII, Bacon and eggs could be higher quality Beans were slightly cold 
Henry VIII, Decor is tired and needs updating carpets in the hall on level 5 had dribbles of bleach staining etc that made it look a little shabby The breakfast was average and the Coffee from the machines was TERRIBLE Also I extended my stay from 4 to 5 for 1 extra night agreed this with the reception and was told the price and said that was all fine but when I came to check out they said the price was higher than agreed with no explanation Also please note I did my search on Booking com for a hotel with car parking This hotel came up on the search but does NOT have parking and it cost me an additional 135 gbp for parking about 10mins away A little scam on the search criteria by the hotel and a little cavet is hidden in the small print Naughty 
Henry VIII, The doors and walls are thin as paper you can hear every single step and people passing by 
Henry VIII, Staff was rude unfriendly and insulting They would not speak English in front of guests and would talk about them I understood what they were saying and it wasn t nice The carpet was old and filthy The dining room was disgustingly dirty I was afraid to sit on the chairs they were so soiled I also found something weird in the milk and gave it to one of the waitresses and was never apologized to nor was the problem corrected 
Henry VIII, The apparently 4 star hotel is more like a bed and breakfast bedsit The initial room that I was allocated smelled absolutely terrible I requested to be moved and was initially told they had no more rooms I asked to speak to someone senior and then my request was honored Once in the new room which was a slight improvement I noticed an unpleasant human deposit in the shower This is my first time writing a review based on my bad experience HENRY you have a lot of improving to do if you want to be king 
Henry VIII, Small room could not upgrade when checking in despite being promised over the phone that it would be possible bad quality bed kept moving and the head board fell off The air conditioning unit was too loud and kept waking us up
Henry VIII, I booked a double room because I thought the single rooms might be small My room had threadbare carpet was tiny and left no room to move
Henry VIII, The hotel is old with tiny rooms and technical problems It was very cold when central heating went off in the first night Small lamps for the reading are not working Technical support came once but didnt fix it and left many dangerous glass pieces behind on the floor in the carpenter We cleaned it by ourselves Its almost not possible to watch TV without standing in the front of it angle position and size of screen Breakfast is nothing special you can get for the twice less money three times better English breakfast on the same street
Henry VIII, To single beds pushed together Fell in between them twice and bathroom was dirty wooden floor was coming up would of not said a 4 star hotel 
Henry VIII, Hairdryer blew out luke warm air Shower hard to turn on Breakfast Hot plates but luke warm food Sausages looked as if microwaved left them alone Otherwise OK 
Henry VIII, Breakfast was standard We did not always have warm hot water can be a pain if you like to shower warm Walls are thin we could hear the next doors guest snore hope he was alone in his room 
Henry VIII, I didn t like the style of the room as we were given the room next to the lift and so was T shaped making it feel small
Henry VIII, The room was too small for a double bed The water was cold on the 2nd morning and the bedroom furniture was tired and damaged The cooked breakfast food was poor 
Henry VIII, Unfortunetly the boiler broke down in the night and our room was very cold and still hadn t been fixed in the morning at 9 30 am so woke up cold in the night and couldn t have a shower before leaving the hotel so left to warm up in a near by cafe 
Henry VIII, Bathroom door didn t close no lock on it Was woken on first night by room service in error She did apologise for knocking on the wrong door 
Henry VIII, our room was very shabby and if you are not a lover of lifts forget this one they are so tiny we were on the 5th floor absolute night are felt like we were climbing the shard 
Henry VIII, The room was poor and not comfortabe had the smallest TV ever duvet was wafer thin as were the pillows Hair dryer was hopeless no iron but did have a trouser press no help if you want to iron a blouse shower took ages to heat to a decent temp and taps were very stiff 
Henry VIII, I was in a box room with the train line outside my window and the elevator the opposite side of the wall I didn t sleep well due to the noise Hard to get comfy due to lack of space in the room TV also did not work 
Henry VIII, Room was very noisy could hear everything in reception Complained several times regarding the noise of staff in reception Was then moved to a better room the following night 
Henry VIII, We are shocked this has been given a 4 star and will be contacting to feed back The room was smaller than a servants quarter in a state home We were in the atic The curtian was ripped with a hole in it also did not draw closed and fit Receiption staff told me that they will fix this and change in the morning and heard them talk to house keeping Returned home that evening and still not done The hindge of the cupboard was broken Dust on the celing fan You could not sit on the toilet as a sink was blocking your knees The swimming pool needed desprate repair And sauna door did not close properly causing heat to escape Cement was needed on stairs into pool Grouting needed with new paint What we saw in the picture advertising the hotel was heaverly photo shopped Therefor making the hotel site diseving Limited drinks in the bar No cocktails available Just beer sprits soft drinks and wine Staff show no concern and customer services really do not exist The hindge was fixed after complaining But why was this not picked up before room available Television was about 13 inch in width Air com does not work and the doors to the belcony did not open as locked Good job no fire Booking com filter showed this hotel as having parking however being disabled there was no parking Will say the receiption did get us a space on the hard stand Every language spoken but fluent English In our opion did not even speak my partners language I really would not recommend this hotel as better places in london and round the cornor More to write on trip adviser 
Henry VIII, The hotel was very tired and in need of refurbishment The room was like being in Henry VIII s broom cupboard and the breakfast was pretty disappointing In particular the coffee self service from a machine was vile Had to go out immediately after for proper coffee 
Henry VIII, The beans at breakfast were cold and the other food items were not warm such as the sausages The coffee machine did not work properly The hotel provided large mugs to the customers yet the coffee machine only provided less than half a the mug of coffee I attempted to order a cappacino and the machine made the drink without any milk The toilet did not flush effectively it kept getting blocked The bathroom tap splashed a lot of water out of the sink when first turned on The TV in the room did not have a decent connection The lifts were too small so had to wait for lifts if already full 3 people in the lift would deem it to be full 
Henry VIII, The room bed its noisy got no sleep at all and when I complained was told to make the best of it so also insulting staff to add to it I would not call the scraps put out breakfast At 150 a night I should be given my money back as you can t call this a hotel never again 
Henry VIII, The room was a bit small but very clean 
Henry VIII, No good staff tried to contact 3 times to confirm the booking and they put me in wait small room all Spanish staff very noisy and small room not clean 
Henry VIII, Wifi was crap Room way too small TV faced wall unable to see it Wardrobe got caught in bed when tried to open as room was tiny No space even to open my suitcase Door of bathroom wasn t even a real door Extremely disappointed Room not like photos 
Henry VIII, Single room considerably smaller than double but cost almost as much
Henry VIII, Just a little modernisation needed
Henry VIII, Smelt quite a lot of cigarette smoke on coming out of lift on the 2nd floor 
Henry VIII, There should be a sign in the corridors that from midnight no noise or silence as some guests were too loud and didn t respect other people s sleep
Henry VIII, Cooked Breakfast was mediocre and selection incomplete No mushroom no cooked tomatoes the scrambled eggs were inedible and the quality of the sausages poor In the hotels defence the continental selection looked entirely satisfactory but that s no good when you want a full English The room was adequate functional and sparse My room 118 was next to the lift shaft so the motor could be heard throughout the night A friend of mine stayed same nights in a room on the 4th floor and his comment was that my room was positive luxury compared to his which doesn t sound good This hotel is ok if you are a one night stayer but I would not stay there again for multiple nights 
Henry VIII, A bit worn but not overly so Do note the Lancaster Gate tube station Central line is set to be eliminated in January 
Henry VIII, Getting disturbed at 5 30am by reception for a taxi for the wrong room Without a proper apology Even when I said it was not for us he continue to say was I sure Really Yes I think I would know if I had a plane to catch from Heathrow 
Henry VIII, You can hear everything there is no isolation between the walls The pool is tiny 
Henry VIII, the air conditioning heater in the room didnt work the bed was uncomforatble and the door on the toilet was broken room 111 
Henry VIII, The breakfast could ve had more options and the hotel should have some way of providing some dinner options no cooking after 6 30pm and only sandwiches before The hallway and room also smelled like someone had been smoking there for some reason Maybe it was the carpet 
Henry VIII, Double Room was quite small could just about squeeze past the bed to get to other side Bar didnt open until 8pm Not good if you fancied a drink before then 
Henry VIII, Room was very expensive Bar was closed Room was very small TV in room was tiny Bed in strange position and not centre of the room
Henry VIII, Breakfst awful Coffee machine not working and grotty and cleaning sign flashing Bed was teeny Don t stay in standard room if larger than size UK10 worst night s sleep ever Receptionist told me I should of noted bed measurements before booking Carpets worn Needs updating I will stick to Premier Inn in future
Henry VIII, The staff was not knowledgeable about the airport buses and when or where they left from they gave us poor information and we ended up having to take a cab which cost a fortune 
Henry VIII, This is a very very shabby hotel The carpets were threadbare and a definite trip hazard especially in the main lobby reception area and on the stairs There are very small trip steps in the corridors that actually caused me to fall many times The last time I injured my hand and asked to make an entry in the accident book What accident book I was asked that says it all Health and safety need to take a close look at this hotel for hazards Also the bathrooms were very small if you were over 80kg you would not get in the bathroom 
Henry VIII, Although clean overall I found that the bathroom could have been better We had a large crack in the shower tray and jelly beans on the floor present throughout and prior to our stay 
Henry VIII, Room was a bit warm and the control was not working but I am sure this was a temporary glitch 
Henry VIII, Very inflexible with our booking On booking com website I added what I was looking for in the search bar stating a room for 2 adults and one 9 year old child it offered the rooms available at this hotel and having given the criteria I assumed the search would ONLY reveal rooms which were suitable for me thinking it was suitable else why is it on the list given my criteria I clicked and gave card details Booking was confirmed however I thought I had better check that this double would be suitable and I politely requested a small put up bed for the child as it showed a double room on my confirmation the hotel said no so I politely requested an extra pillow and duvet so we could make up a little bed on floor hotel said no I enquiries why not Health and safety Very Very inflexible booking com appealed for their help with my booking no luck I also spoke to manager she refused and refused to let me cancel as I was within 24 hours of arrival date Booking com were very helpful and couldn t understand the hotel s inflexible approach to my booking which was done in good faith and on the assumption that a little camp bed would be offered NEVER ASSUME Very expensive hotel for what was offered decoration tired in places breakfast very average cheap marmalade and jam mass market stuff coffee and tea from vending machine All in all poor disappointing really as a little more flexibility would ensure a happy customer not so 
Henry VIII, Hotel was booked as a double but it was two single beds pushed together the bathroom tiles on the floor was lose and dangerous to walk on the heating in the room didn t work and the window not closing properly 
Henry VIII, Do not think this hotel is for a 4 star level Rooms are way to small and bathroom was poorly done Plastic around the bathtub was broken and looked horrible Breakfast is I guess typical English like in some other hotels but not offering a variety of international food 
Henry VIII, broken shower broken bathtub old carpets poor wifi The whole hotel needs a full refresh I don t understand how they got their 4 stars Even the breakfast was poor 
Henry VIII, A hotel that s needs a lot of love and TLC You know things arent good when the TV remote control doesn t work when the water doesn t drain from the sink when a double bed is pushed against one wall so you can get out of bed the other side and when the safe is so safe you can t get to it without being either a magician or a catorcinist And guess what no mention of Thomas the Tank engine railway line running under my room Not good Not good at all 
Henry VIII, Main room was rather cold no bedside light on one side of the bed and light came in round the curtains 
Henry VIII, The room was tiny but you couldn t fault it really as it contained everything you would need from hair dryer to trouser press 
Henry VIII, The rooms were VERY small and even though we booked a double room the bed would not fit us 
Henry VIII, the room was a shoe box with the smallest Tv I have ever seen Very basic room not worth anywhere near the cost of the room Very disappointing
Henry VIII, This is not a 4 star hotel 1 star b b would be pushing it totally deceptive photos will stay at the Hilton next time considering it s the same price 
Henry VIII, Reception appearance could do with a make over 
Henry VIII, uhm the carpet on the floor but this is London right 
Henry VIII, The size of the bed Too small 
Henry VIII, The room was meant to be a superior room however it was small a train roared past every ten minutes and the carpet was thread bare and dirty
Henry VIII, The hotel is old the elevator is not trustworthy The twin room is very small the bathroom is tiny The furniture is weary The hairdryer work a minute then you have to re charge it The rooms look bigger and nicer on the photos 
Henry VIII, The fan didn t work and kept blinking throughout the night The curtains stop just short of the floor which kind of defeats the purpose since all the cold air flows in There seemed to never be any forks around at breakfast one had to specifically ask for one which was a bit odd Very small issues basically 
Henry VIII, Generally tired decor and dirty No hot water and had to move rooms at midnight Offered us 9 discount for the inconvenience Breakfast was poor Cheap sausages powdered egg 
Henry VIII, Floors are creaky and annoying especially if you have neighbors who pace above you all night hotel is not sound proof and water pressure is terrible elevators are like a death trap Owners really need to invest in some renovations The exterior of the building is beautiful 
Henry VIII, Keep out from room facing to the yard specially on the right hand side there is roofless tube line directly below windows with really loud noise But our room was changed very quickly to the street facing side 
Henry VIII, Minimal rooms I found lower prices for the same room in a lower price and they don t respect his own best price guarantee Air conditioner doesn t work room hot because swimming pool below bathroom tooooo small noisy subway running below I reserved standar double two days and I paid expensive double room for the next five days but they don t gave me nothing bigger Advertise says chocolate wine bottle of wat and till now I didn t see nothing Ahhh comfortable but small bed and full of old carpets Thinking to call UK customers protection advice 
Henry VIII, Room very poor very hot and probably the worst room in hotel at a guess because of discount booking web site Bed uncomfortable felt like springs gone left back sore by morning air conditioning not working in a room that needed it to be place looking tired inside price does not reflect value for money Far better off staying in travel lodge consistency basic but works value for money 
Henry VIII, Very small room No tables at breakfast staff slow to clear plates etc it was very disorganised Pool a waste of time more like a bath sauna nowhere near hot enough 
Henry VIII, Very grubby hotel rooms tiny no room to get ready in desperate need off refurbishment swimming pool grubby and sauna not working only room for one person in there usless you want some one on your shoulders and once again staff do not even ask on depature if everything is ok which I find rather rude I would not stay here again
Henry VIII, The restaurant breakfast staff came across as largely indifferent to customers needs and issues The scrambled eggs were consistently the worst I ve ever come across gritty and dry The free wifi kept dropping out despite good signal strength and it was frustrating having to re enter passwords all the time The furnishings and carpets in the common areas were starting to look quite shabby 
Henry VIII, No AC in all rooms faulty in our room Tiny TV with 5 channels not in English Very uncomfortable bed bed base was a twin with a queen mattress on top meaning that you are falling off the end of the bed due to overhanging Restaurant was not open at nights so no option to purchse food even though we were told by reception that it would be open Some of the bulbs in the room were blown UIneven corridors with sudden drops without signs to warn led to me tripping over 
Henry VIII, Dark dank and depressing Avoid this hotel at all costs It is not 4 star by any stretch of the imagination in fact I have stayed in better budget hostels 
Henry VIII, Breakfast wasn t very good Rooms were basic We could hear the person in the next room snoring Very bad bar facilities 
Henry VIII, We ve stayed at this hotel on three different trips It has gotten shabbier as the years have gone by and maintenance has been ignored I expect small rooms in London but the value just isn t there anymore We ll try another hotel when we come back to London in 2018 
Henry VIII, After 10 days the breakfast became very boring same choices everyday Also didn t like that there was only fat free yoghurt and the fruit was fairly bland tasting would have been nice to have fried or poached eggs for a change 
Henry VIII, Air conditioning did not work in the whole hotel room too hot old not modern inside very basic noise from next room people talking bed not comfortable would not stay there again Bad choice of hotel 
Henry VIII, Shower didn t work The shower has got to work Paid for double bed Only single Room was small but OK In a corner 3 rooms very close Quite noisy Staff didn t do anything when told of problems Apologised for shower But no offer to get snyone to contact Showing to age 
Henry VIII, Decor size of rooms quality of bedding were not what one would expect for a 4 star hotel Scrambled egg was disgusting possibly made from powdered eggs
Henry VIII, The rooms are very very small If you have two large suitcases forget it It is either you or the suitcases There is a train that goes by every so often Mainly in the daytime but you can also hear it early evening 
Henry VIII, Inside the hotel is very run down staffed by uninterested clueless Spanish staff with a very poor command of English The dining room is located in the basement and is airless and hot The food on offer for breakfast was appalling Hot food served barely warm with a broken down hot drinks machine Cheapest cereals and sliced bread provided The bedrooms are very spartan and the provision of basic toiletries virtually non existent It seems as though the owners are using this hotel solely as a means to generate revenue without spending a penny on the building or its amenities This is a great shame as it could be an excellent place to stay 
Henry VIII, I couldn t work the air conditioning unit and the room was very warm I experienced the same problem the last time I was there I was woke up around 6ish by a loud gushing noise like something firing up which then continued to drone on quite noisily ovens boiler My breakfast wasn t that pleasant I didn t like the cereal choice so opted for scrambled egg which was like rubber I had breakfast at 7 15 so it should have been quite fresh The croissants were very hard and dry 
Henry VIII, The heating was broken They didn t tell me until I asked them how to get it to work Very dismissive Apparently they don t guarantee heating Very odd Breakfast was average I ve stayed in a similar location paid half the price had a bigger room nicer decor heating and a better breakfast Disappointing 
Henry VIII, The bed mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable Noisy patrons on the second night made the bed situation worse We left the hotel at 7 30 am the next day frankly relieved not to be spending any more time at the Henry VIII
Henry VIII, There was nothing I didn t like A tiny criticism was at breakfast I was taken to my table but given no advise on how to help myself to everything but it wasn t a big deal 
Henry VIII, I wish the bed was a little more comfortable and the shower had better water pressure 
Henry VIII, Not worthy to pay that amount of money I dont know why it is 4 star hotel bathroom very stink even the door closed still lingering the smell in the bedroom aircon broken We called the receptionist staff but she told us that she cannot do anything about It We booked double bed but the 2 single bed joined together even the headboard is too far apart Location nice breakfast but the rest very bad Not worthy to pay that amount of money I dont know why it is 4 star hotel bathroom very stink even the door closed still lingering the smell in the bedroom aircon broken We called the receptionist staff but she told us that she cannot do anything aboit It We booked double bed but the 2 single bed joined together even the headboard is too far apart You can hear the noise of the underground tube 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, All I want really from a hotel room is a Good Shower and unfortunately the room I was in had a rubbish shower 2 temps Freezing and scalding and not enough pressure 
Henry VIII, Room smelt of cigarette smoke when we arrived Not really their fault though because guests aren t supposed to smoke Room was pretty small but we were in the lowest category so that was fair enough Coffee from the machine at breakfast wasn t very nice 
Henry VIII, Room was a lil cramped and the elevator claustrophobic but really couldn t complain much 
Henry VIII, Nowhere to leave luggage as the room was not ready so we had to carry our cases with us for a while which was inconvenient The bar was NEVER opened during our stay and there was nowhere in the hotel just to sit during the day to have a cup of tea or coffee 
Henry VIII, The basic rooms are indeed very basic very tiny no space around the bed small bathrooms and mine had a noisy air conditioning unit 
Henry VIII, No air conditioning and unable to open window enough to get some cool air Although the reception area was cooled the guest rooms were like an oven Many guests were very irate 
Henry VIII, AC is not guaranteed in the rooms Get a fan 
Henry VIII, See above
Henry VIII, I was given the wrong room I paid for a double and they kept telling me that they would change me another one but they did not the shower did not work the first day the other two days it work improperly The staff always has excuses about why they could not give me a manager to talk to Worst stay in London ever and so expensive Incredible they still in business Uncaring irresponsible robbery 
Henry VIII, The rooms were smaller than expected and toilet privacy could be an issue however for a 1 night stay it was adequate The young lady on reception was under considerable pressure to checkout many guests at the same time which led to quite a lengthy queue and some irate guests It would have been better if she had some assistance 
Henry VIII, Don t get fooled it s not a four star hotel Maybe three Interior is completely outdated The girl in reception was nice and friendly but she was trying to do a work of two Checking out took us 30 minutes 
Henry VIII, Wasn t sure that the property s star rating was right 3 star is just about right but the room facilities were a little wanting
Henry VIII, room very dated sink in the bathroom plug did not work and could only get a dribble of cold water the shower was just as bad AIR CONDITIONING DID NOT WORK the room was very hot there were fans in the room these were noisey had to sleep with window open that was noisey as well the pillows were not fluffy it was like sleeping on rocks Breakfast was not the best cold bacon undercooked potatoes only egg choice was over cooked scrambled eggs there was a fruit choice but is was in big slices making it hard to eat we went to use the pool no towels no lounger to relax on THE SIDES IN THE POOL WERE FILTHY we would not use it because of the fithy scum all around the sides
Henry VIII, Staff not friendly staff also struggled with understanding English Bed was very uncomfortable and you only had one not so soft pillow to sleep with Sauna in pool also didn t work carpet throughout premises was dirty and well worn
Henry VIII, The breakfast staff were very rude and unfriendly Our room had a view of 3 very high concrete walls right outside the window and an air conditioning unit so couldn t see daylight The pool area was small had no chairs or loungers to sit on and the sauna was very very small 
Henry VIII, The bed was small uncomfortable A C didn t work Ceiling fan is great with window open the sound of the trains is hard to sleep
Henry VIII, Nothing
Henry VIII, This isn t a bad budget hotel But it is not 4 Maybe a good example of you get what you pay for but grossly misleading classification 
Henry VIII, The air conditioning didn t work in either of the 2 rooms we rented Bedrooms a little small
Henry VIII, Hotel a little tired with some worn out carpeting but great value for money 
Henry VIII, The rooms were old and tired as was most of the hotel they were very very small and the air con unit didn t work the hotel was very dated with carpets that looked like they had been there since Henry 8th last visited I honestly can t understand why this hotel is classed as a 4 star as the swimming pool must be tidal with the tide mark that surrounded the pool that come off when rubbed with your finger I ve had warmer ice creams than the what the sauna was I didn t feel at all safe in the lift and expected at any given minute to plummet to my death with the rickety old bone shaker of a lift they have better lift facilities going into a mine shaft this is literally one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in and travelling to London on a regular basis from now on I ll stay in a travel lodge Very poor all round 
Henry VIII, Needed a bit of refurbishment
Henry VIII, Humidity smell in the bathroom Constant noise Overall the hotel is poorly maintained 
Henry VIII, Tired decor and carpeting that needed updating Our room was comfortable but bath and bath panel were damaged Also no hot water in the bathroom sink
Henry VIII, Very small room Underground passes every minute from early morning to past midnight above surface and just below the hotel Not clean smelly very old and badly maintained Black spots and humidity in the bathroom It must have been quite a good hotel long time ago needs much refurbishment and maintenance 
Henry VIII, The hotel itself was a little noisy think we were located below a generator
Henry VIII, Decor is a bit dated and worn but everywhere is clean Something funny about the scrambled eggs like they were powdered Nice swimming pool but limited spaces to change shower Makes you feel very exposed 
Henry VIII, The hotel was tired looking worn carpets The pool was not very good photos misleading Rooms small and some noise from near by tube line 
Henry VIII, liked a lot about the hotel although thought the bar opening times could be reviewed as not tended to opened during the day and closed at 11pmthought this may be more midnight TV was small in my room 
Henry VIII, My room over looked the tube not a major issue but very noisy Breakfast was very average I had pre paid for it but only bothered turning up twice on a 4 night stay Great little cafe 50 yards down the road 
Henry VIII, Rooms and corridors could do with an update They seem very worn and could do with a little tlc Also slow closing doors would be good as room doors slam shut Not good for residents wanting a lie in or for little fingers 
Henry VIII, The size of the room spoilt the trip It was advertised as a 4 star and to me the hotel was a one star Tiny grim rooms 
Henry VIII, Broken sink doors and windows not closing properly in the first room Taking full day to find another room Beds mattresses could have used a replacement several years ago Breakfast are very monotonous especially if staying for more than a few days 
Henry VIII, Room was small Just barely room for the bed 
Henry VIII, A standard double for two would have been very cramped Better for a single traveller 
Henry VIII, the staff was rude and they did not speak fluent english Unbelievable for a London hotel close to Hyde Park Especially the Spanish girl in the reception could not understand words as outstanding and remaining in order to explain us the situation with the bill When someone works in a reception should be able to understand and speak the international language and not to be rude with the customers that pay him 
Henry VIII, The staff was extremely rude and with a real bad knowledge of english They barely understood english The one receptionist informed us that the payment took place before our arrival and we did not owe anything and the next day a rude girl in the reception informed us that we had to pay the full amount and no payment had taken place Moreover when we request from the reception a taxi they said that they order one but the taxi arrived half an hour later and when i went to reception to request to call the taxi again they answered to me Get a black cup taxi from the road Finally in the bathroom s sink there were brown stains that i had to clean them by my own when we arrived 
Henry VIII, The first room we had was way too small squeaky floorboards in room and rooms above no proper changing facilities at pool sauna can only house 2 people double bed not really a standard double very small for two people air con didn t work in first room having to pay to move to another room
Henry VIII, No fridge in the rooms
Henry VIII, Air conditioning did not work There was a desk fan in the room so it was obvious the hotel were aware the air con was broken It was the hottest day of the year 32 degrees so it was very uncomfortable Not good enough to have facilities that are broken Carpet very worn disgustingly old and looked dirty Repairs had been made to the wardrobe door with polyfilla Very cramped in the room Tv kept turning itself off and could only be seen from one side of the bed Lots of broken things that needed repairs 
Henry VIII, It s a bit faded and worn and without a restaurant does not really rate 4 stars The pool and sauna are well kept but very small not suitable for any serious exercise 
Henry VIII, my t v didnt work no signal so the tech guy came in and worked half an hour changed cables and still didnt work so i got a compensation but only after i asked for it you would expect a more professional approach plus the place is all a bit shaby not a 4 star hotel maybe 2 
Henry VIII, The air conditioning working Comfier beds and duvets Frozen potatoes
Henry VIII, the hotel is old and tired my room was about the same size as my walk in closet at home and the AC for the entire building did not work 
Henry VIII, Stained carpets Size of room and lack of ventilation Bathroom standard folding door entrance TV very small and view blocked 
Henry VIII, Hotel is old and needs to be renovated soon i guest that s why the prices are so good However our room was clean 
Henry VIII, I specifically chose this hotel because it was close to our meeting the following day and your website stated there was parking which I understood to mean that there was off road parking There wasn t Apart from that major inconvenience I didn t sleep well as the mattress was very hard The room was very small and there was a recurring noise outside the window every 5 or 10 minutes throughout the night which exacerbated my already restless sleep hard mattress Bathroom door kept opening spontaneously and sink was a bit blocked More like 3 than 4 
Henry VIII, Room very small no air conditioning bathroom very very small and cramped with no ventilation shower basic and very cramped room very warm uncomfortable if weather is warm with very little ventilation their is a room fan but just circulating warmth around very expensive for price of room
Henry VIII, I had a twin room with a friend and was just chatting over a cup of tea before bed and next door banged on wall as well as coming to the door aggressively We also received a call from reception Quietly chatting g should be accepted as norm so will not use again as you can t be silent I would ha e understood if we were noisy
Henry VIII, Room with less than 10m2 for 180 is by far too much Impossible to stay in the room as bed took half of the space Windows are not noise isolated and we were directly exposed to the train noise
Henry VIII, Room No 1 was tiny immediately outside the window is some piece of equipment heating aircon I think that was permanently on sound levels varying from loud to very loud If that wasn t bad enough disturbed sleep man on reception reacted to my comment as if I was the first person ever to complain about it Reception area is tired and looks grubby 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Very dated Small tv Facilities unclean Baby bed dirty and unclean Given a free upgrade dread to think what we would have got 
Henry VIII, In need of upgrade Noisy trains from rear rooms Hair dryer not working Shown to table at breakfast but no explanation of what to do 
Henry VIII, Unclean carpets on 5th floor corridor unclean kettle unclean carpet noisy staff showing new guests rooms at 1 and 2 am noisy lift filthy curtains no option to check door locked from inside couldn t leave windows open as you could get in from another room along roof Single solo men on sofas with no apparent reason not reading or waiting in reception made us feel uncomfortabe on arrival reception area dark and crumbs etc all over the carpet scruffy
Henry VIII, The room was so small The TV didn t work The breakfast was ok the English breakfast was on additional cost Breakfast ended at 10 no chance to get a further cup of coffee at 10 01 
Henry VIII, Cleanliness could of been better the beding was filthy stained and the hotel bar was only open from 8 11pm
Henry VIII, The room was nothing to write home about and bed was too small for the price we paid 150 is a lot to pay for 1 nights stay Rooms were too tiny
Henry VIII, can t see why it was a 4 star seemed more like a 2 or at best 3 i believe other hotels in the area probably offer better value better location and better facilities
Henry VIII, This is a 3 star hotel at best not the 4 stars it is advertised as 170 for a very small room is a lot of money They have air con but it is switched off I was worried about road noise with the window open humid day but as it happens it wasn t a problem 
Henry VIII, Two single beds joined together poorly to make a double bed Poor quality ingredients used for breakfast Hotel appears tired in places for instance carpet was worn in places 
Henry VIII, We were given a key to the wrong room and proceeded to walk into a room which had people s stuff in which could have been very embarrassing for both parties if the people had been in the room at the time We were understanding with the staff and didn t make a fuss When returning to the hotel the next night our keycard had stopped working on our lock so had to go and ask them to fix it Luckily we were on ground floor but if we d been on 4th as per our original room it would ve been very annoying Asked if we could cancel the second night as our plans had changed told a flat no by front desk staff It was ok but I wouldn t stay here again 
Henry VIII, It s not the most stylish hotel you ever stayed in I m 6 2 I ask for a double bed so I can sleep diagonally across the bed when 2 single beds are pushed together it s not comfortable And the lighting was harsh 
Henry VIII, There was a huge disgusting cockroach in my room so horrible that I am now terrified of hotels in general when I complained the staff just moved me to another worse room and refused to make any other amends for this disgusting experience They told me they had one very small mouse recently but never cockroaches well that s reassuring isn t it 
Henry VIII, The room was dirty the sheets had clearly not been changed and the staff were extremely unhelpful I decided to look for another hotel to stay at and will be requesting a refund 
Henry VIII, Sound proofing in room 507 was absolutely appalling This room should not be allowed to be let Plus very unsecure with a flimsy wooden door separating the two rooms 
Henry VIII, The hotel is tired especially in the common areas Staff are not over friendly especially in the restaurant area at breakfast TV and air con didn t work properly 
Henry VIII, I had the room 3 ifyou get it do t take it you can hear every single noise from outside espacialy early morning 
Henry VIII, Kids swimming classes are given in the pool so its noisy and full of kids Elevator is so slow Room is extremly slow Wifi cuts off sometimes 
Henry VIII, The Swimming pool was a little small and there was no proper changing rooms but minor point really as the lift is close by I just got ready in my room instead 
Henry VIII, Not really a dislike but the room was as small as possible while still containing the bed However the bathroom was very nice with comfortably roomy shower C est la vie in London 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, I booked in via booking com The mix up began when I arrived at the hotel The room was too small and then I was told I can have an upgrade this did not happen The lack of clarity and mix ups No GM in a 115 room hotel Front Office manager takes care things poorly No fridge TV is minuscule inside drawers are dirty
Henry VIII, The mushrooms in the breakfast weren t nice it was almost like they were pickled 
Henry VIII, I wouldn t say the hotel is a 4 more of a 3 The Breakfast was mediocre many of the pastries were rock hard There was quite a bit of dust in our room and the loo roll holder was broken They didn t replenish the tea and coffee facilities in our room for the second night of our stay 
Henry VIII, Room clean enough but very small and too warm Paint flaking off the bathroom ceilng Hotel Very old fashioned i choose it for the pool but on a Sunday morning its used for childrens swimming lessons Local Shops do not buy from the shops just up the street they charge stupidily 
Henry VIII, Did not feel it was 4 as advertised First room was unacceptable and when we complained although they moved us the staff did not seem happy about this nor particularly helpful 
Henry VIII, Very basic facilities and small rooms However wasn t a problem as we were out all day and only sleeping there 
Henry VIII, Only Spanish TV channels reception under charged me on check in neither of us noticed but they then proceeded to ring my room at 11 30pm to ask for the extra money Had to go down I reception barefoot and half asleep to do this A little extreme for 5 
Henry VIII, The breakfast rates as one of the worst we have ever had in a London hotel The food items though plentiful were not fresh when we went to eat at 9am The bread roll s and pastries were both too hard to eat We even had to queue to press the button on the drinks machine for a hot drink The water was not hot enough to make a cup of tea and the coffee was lukewarm You are clearly not catering for the British market 
Henry VIII, I was told free checkout until 1pm I asked reception if it was possible to have later checkout until 3pm and was told this would be a charge of 20 I was then asked for 40 as the late checkout until 1pm was not free Inaccurate information was given lack of communication through staff members 
Henry VIII, very small rooms 8m2 old hotel you can hear every noise from everywhere I could hear every noise from the next room elevator etc There is a railway very close so you can hear train all the time Terrible I went to reception to change the room but of course the only available room was more more expensive etc Would never go there again
Henry VIII, Parking was a nightmare we thought the hotel had parking facilities as it appeared to show this on the website so kept having to ensure parking meters were kept fed 
Henry VIII, Breakfast is self service buffet style so plenty of it but poor quality Limited bar on site but good pub 50 yards away The A C was temperamental and a bit uncontrollable in my room 
Henry VIII, The only thing was the shower which was over the bath This was not very powerful and hard to keep a suitable temp either too hot or too cold 
Henry VIII, Booked a double but allocated a twin on arrival Swapped O K after we returned to reception Rooms too small but this often the case in London Premises old and tired needs redecorating Pool not available due to a technical problem on the day we arrived Also unable to use sauna steam room for the same reason TV in room only 12 inch Reception staff disinterested and appeared to help grudgingly pretending to not understand English very well No parking on the premises but used another hotel about 200m away 
Henry VIII, Room was small but this is expected in London 
Henry VIII, The shower in my room didn t work initially They did send a guy to fix it but this wasn t in time for me as I had to leave for a meeting 
Henry VIII, Dark and dreary breakfast room very small sauna more like a cupboard small pool with noisy kids for swimming lessons
Henry VIII, Hotel was in need of refurb a very typical small basic London B B style hotel An OK place to stay but not somewhere to have guests meet you
Henry VIII, Carpets filthy room so tiny we couldn t even sneezed no cold water on the tap and shower breakfast really down to basics air conditioner not working in the room I didn t mind about having only Spanish people around us staff customers as I understand but it might be disturbing 
Henry VIII, The floor in my room creaked every time I would walk through it Nothing major just a little annoying 
Henry VIII, English breakfast was cold tried to give a double room with 2single beds put together and the bar was not open 
Henry VIII, The room was very small and compact but had everything we could have wanted 
Henry VIII, Dated decor and looking tired I booked a superior single but was told that this option doubles up as a standard single There was nothing superior about this room 
Henry VIII, The cooked breakfast was pretty poor low quality ingredients 
Henry VIII, The staff spoke some English but it was not their first language and often simple questions received odd answers or none at all The hotel also appeared to be home to some refugees who refused to respect privacy and were loud despite us having a young baby trying to sleep even after we asked them to be quieter Breakfast was Ok but cleanliness and the decor left a lot to be desired 
Henry VIII, the bed was not as comfortable as expected Needed more toiletries in the bathroom only one small soap was there 
Henry VIII, Breakfast was poor the quality of the produce was low Limited choice not of a high quality The room the floor boards creaked badly I thought I was at at sea in a Old fashioned ship The rooms are in need of real modernisation The shower was poor not stopped at a hotel with a tap mixer shower Poor The hotel had a feel of a contractors hotel more like a hostel than a quality hotel
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, The air conditioner didn t work as it kept beeping and giving an error message so I switched it off Thankfully a working ceiling fan was available I did notify the front desk when we checked out to raise a maintenance ticket for its repair The tv was a luxury but it would have been really good to have had UK morning news but as the reception was so poor on the only available channels we watched the UK news on the ipad 
Henry VIII, One tip only they should have a 24hr bar or atleast for breakfast lunch and dinner doesn t need to be open throught the night but it would be good if it was 
Henry VIII, Kitchen sink in room is needed instead of having to use bathroom water only flaw
Henry VIII, The hotel needs some upgrades The rugs are worn my shower didn t work to a standard expected in a London hotel
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, The only thing I felt upset about was I missed breakfast and got the times wrong and asked to be given some in my room and I was told no which was upsetting Apart from that I had no problems 
Henry VIII, 1 Staff need more attention to detail For example reception didn t ask have you stayed before Breakfast is downstairs in the restaurant bar area and at breakfast they took my room number gave me a table and that was it I would have expected them to ask if I knew where everything was rather than feeling you had to fend for yourself I am harsh but have worked in catering and expect a decent standard 2 Food provided for room service is appalling Brakes congealed tomato soup and walkers ready salted crisps no bread roll Was cheap and nasty and charged 7 00 for the pleasure of it I feel if you are going to offer room service do it properly Also room service was advertised between 7 11 and when I rang I was told it wasn t until 8pm No apology given After 8pm it took me six attempts to order as the bar didn t answer If you want to provide guests drinks and don t have the catering staff put in a mini bar I had a cupboard in my room that was a perfect candidate for conversion The menu was mostly drinks which says a lot It made me wish I had gone and bought something from sainsburys 3 Could do with a refurbishment I stayed in 108 and the side of the bath was coming off No carpet in the rooms and makes it feel cheap Advertised as 4 but feels budget if I compare to other 4 hotels I have stayed at 4 No gown or slippers provided for use of spa facilities Reception should warn you of this and how to use pool etc 
Henry VIII, The room was a little impersonal as we could hear noise from neighbouring rooms so I m sure they could hear us Also when down for breakfast towards the end of service several guests were I felt they wanted to clear up more than allow the guests to enjoy breakfast with the same quality as guests who went for breakfast earlier 
Henry VIII, Room could do with a refurb Smelt of cigarette smoke on third floor
Henry VIII, Out dated 
Henry VIII, nothing particularly bad to say Swimming pool room was quite chilly Room service till 23 only TV could be larger 
Henry VIII, Air con was broken in our room would be a problem in summer 
Henry VIII, The table in our room haf crumbs on it The door to our first room wouldnt open The cleans walked in without knocking even tho we asked for late check out
Henry VIII, There wasn t a restaurant in the hotel 
Henry VIII, Bed was hard damp smell carpets in very bad condition pool and sauna small and had kids swimming lessons going on dirty scum marks around top off pool 
Henry VIII, It s very difficult as I don t know where to start 1 all the staff are foreign which is not bad as itself but the problem was they can t speak English at all You expect that the people who work at reception can speak a good English so you can at least check in 2 found staffs are rude from the reception to the kitchen For instance the trainee receptionist was a young guy with glasses can t remember his name but when I asked him to get me his manager he told me that in his wording I m the boss when my manger is not here He was saying this while he was wearing a trainee name badge 3 very old hotel with scary lift 4 the beds are very small and uncomfortable
Henry VIII, Room very small mould in shower base Dining room very dark and gloomy and staff unhelpful Breakfast very dry coffee awful we went out for breakfast the second day
Henry VIII, Hotel was very tired and shabby it was clean For the money I expected better and should have just booked a travel lodge Pool was nice but no robes and changing area wasn t ideal next to pool side 
Henry VIII, Hopefully you are not planning on using the tv for entertainment my iPad mini could win a competition for size The room is old fashioned and out dated matching the kettle from the 90 s The walls are paper thin and we could hear the conversations being held in the room beside us and the people walking in the room above This is not great when it happens until past 3am The breakfast was average not worth the amount they ask for 
Henry VIII, Room was very small could not see TV from the bed Shower did not work well very low power taps were not secure in the wall very tiny bathroom Bathroom door did not shut well
Henry VIII, Double room was so tiny Twin room was better size No toilet brush Shower didn t close
Henry VIII, Staff had lack of English the corridors smelled like ashtrays the rooms whore tiny boxes the mattress has seen better days years they do not provide a car park Too expensive for what we experienced Problem with payment transaction they charged us twice We do not recommend 
Henry VIII, Room 2 was too small for a couple could not open both wardrobe doors had a water leek from the bathroom ceiling the bar was not open in the evening we were there The price was good and staff were friendly good for Hyde park access 
Henry VIII, I booked a double room but the bed was 3 4 size so not a lot of space room was quite small and at the back adjacent to the exposed tube lines so noisy trains late night and early morning More like a single room than a double The people next door woke us up when they came in at 2am The hot buffet breakfast was cold as it had been out for too long The whole thing was a disappointment and not like our previous stay some years ago I wouldn t go back 
Henry VIII, The room is hot but over all amazing Overall no complaints
Henry VIII, Exceedingly small room and bathroom Upgraded to a larger room eventually but overall a disappointing stay It badly needs a refurbishment in my opinion Tired In the original room we had to tape up the window to stop cold air entering
Henry VIII, Tiny room Windows wouldn t open Freezing shower in morning Room hot and air con wouldn t work receptionist very unhelpful and no apologies Meant to stay 2 nights but checked out after one No manager on duty to discuss getting a refund so left my comments and contact details as yet no ones bothered Dreadful place 
Henry VIII, Cooked breakfast limited and stone cold two mornings in succession despite raising the matter with management on day one
Henry VIII, Our room was tiny It was fine for 1 night but if we had stayed any longer we would have wanted a bit more space to unpack 
Henry VIII, The walls are quite thin and some times the noise in the hallways and adjoining rooms made it difficult to sleep 
Henry VIII, Room was tiny and for over 100 poor value Wardrobe door couldn t open because it was hitting the bed nothing like the pictures on line also crack in the single window 
Henry VIII, Service very average Room tiny Hotel very worn and badly needs an update Breakfast cold and terrible mushrooms from a tin and not even heated up Staff were dismissive at best WiFi useless Not recommended 
Henry VIII, Cleanliness carpets walls and room fan were dusty Room 204 which we had the unfortunate luck to be in was next to the stairs and the in front of the elevators making it quite noisy 
Henry VIII, Two out of three mornings the scrambled eggs beans and bacon were cold Had to ask every morning to refil the lemon water before I could have a drink 
Henry VIII, Tv was very small and the colour contrast was off so everyone was bright orange that was the only downfall and didn t affect us too much as we weren t there to watch tv
Henry VIII, Room next to train noisy at night Breakfast really basic not for a 4 star 3 star hotel max despite good location
Henry VIII, The room was very cold until I called the receptionist in and she had to turn the radiator on herself as the AC Heating unit wasn t working then when I came back from being out all day someone had left my window wide open which being on the ground floor didn t make me feel like my things were secure My bed was a little precarious a king or super king mattress over a much smaller frame so if you sat on the edge of the bed you fell off It was also noisy one because I could hear people shouting in the pool and another because the door didn t have a second lock and every time someone walked past it rattled loudly and made me think someone was trying to get in It was all a little tired really odd repairs done like one side of the door had a small silver handle and the other a larger bronze one so it s very mismatch 
Henry VIII, Even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice When following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable The breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc The lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions Although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm It is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down Even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it All in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided 
Henry VIII, On the first night we were given a room with two single beds room 217 put together even though we requested a double bed The room was dirty and the bed had bed bugs could not sleep all night Next day we changed rooms and moved to 405 which was definitely much better What i disliked about this hotel was the staff especially the manager very unhelpful The hotel charged me twice for the same room and they were unwilling to refund me saying that the reservation was unrefundable which did not make sense as I had already paid it once and was staying at the hotel cleary I showed up for my booking The manager who did not speak good English did not care at all that we were customers and started yelling at us for a mistake that it was theirs I had to contact Booking com to resolve this situation and receive my refund of more than 700 pounds Also a day before my trip to London they contacted me saying that my card details were invalid and that they would cancel my reservation Meanwhile my card was fully charged I had to be with them an hour on the phone so they could find the credit card slip and see that i was already charged Very unhappy Such a shame that this hotel is run by incompetent managers and supervisors 
Henry VIII, Breakfast was a disappointment Although lots of fresh fruit the bacon and scrambled eggs were cold The bread was not always fresh I paid for two single beds but were given a bed for two and I was travelling with my young son 
Henry VIII, The only down point which ruined the start of our day and made us regret booking the hotel as we mainly booked because we could have a morning swim was the fact the swimming pool seemed to be running a toddles swim we went in for half an hour 45 mins during that time 4 toddles had a lesson each one absolutely screamed the house down we normally swim for an hour or so but left early as a child choked so much he was sick spitting water up it wasn t a good start to the day we also wanted to use the sauna but parents were using it as a baby change It was horrible listening to babies choke cry and scream it wasn t on the agenda I believe the hotel should book baby lessons in after 11 as most guest will then head out for the day and at least be able to have a relaxing swim also the instructor had his sister and brother in law in there it felt like we shouldn t of been there despite the fact we paid to stay in the hotel we felt uneasy with the constant children and stares from people it was not a nice experience more like a free public pool then a private pool in a 4 star hotel and is the only thing that would make me not book again
Henry VIII, single bed a tiny bit wobbly and my door wouldn t lock without slamming it however it was fab 
Henry VIII, the room could have been bigger Furniture in room looked a little cheap
Henry VIII, A rather large group of single men were always in the reception and the lifts I found it quite intimidating One of our rooms was very warm 406 and the other was very cold 414 
Henry VIII, The hotel was very tired the carpets threadbare Hairdyer broken in the room and waldrobe door room was very small Staff couldn t understand english
Henry VIII, Hotel for sure not for 4 Stars Room for 3 People not big enough View for roof on the another building maybe cause special Price Swimming pool nice but any part not good for kids too deep for them 
Henry VIII, Your room is a little cold and heating is not warm enough Your shower faucet did not work without any water in Room 501 
Henry VIII, Good choice for breakfast but the milk for the cereals was very strange and the coffee was poor 
Henry VIII, Fridge in the room I thought there was one but we didn t ask either 
Henry VIII, I have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation They took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further 88 over and above the sum due On talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank My son who is from Scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in London with his bank account wiped out I gave it as a gift and am really angry They still haven t refunded the 88 and I am taking this further I was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments They are a bunch of crooks sorry to say Such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them 
Henry VIII, There was no substitute for the bacon and sausage at breakfast as I don t eat pork 
Henry VIII, Woken up most nights with noisy people coming in and out of the rooms 0100 onwards 
Henry VIII, Not much to dislike but if I had to the decor is a bit dated 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Everything looks worn out All televisions in the hotel were not working for the 2 days we were there The wifi speed is so slow it s not worth using The room we had was at the end next to the train line Very noisy 
Henry VIII, The bedside light switches were both broken and needed immediate attention The Tv s were out of action for the full 2 day stay The internet connection was totally inadequate for a hotel The bedroom ceiling fan had not been cleaned in a long time very dusty and dirty
Henry VIII, WiFi too slow and sometimes bad connection I won t suggest take the hotel if you need to work with internet Saw staff taking coffee where we are having breakfast and we needed to wait for him to finish
Henry VIII, The room was very basic TV broken and terrible lights Swimming pool was very small and old looking and no proper changing area for women men 
Henry VIII, When we arrived we had no television reception in the room This was not fixed for our total stay even though we kept reporting it to reception We were told that the fault covered the hotel and not just our room The Internet access was very patchy and kept going down and was very slow 
Henry VIII, Solo Traveller TV didn t work whole time I was there Had breakfast option Only one morning out of three did i try to have breakfast and was simply told we are full No attempt to accomodate me They have done pre authorised transactions on my card 4 times So currently in addtion to the bill being paid I currently have another 290 of my funds in my bank account currently reserved by them which I will not get back for another 7 working days
Henry VIII, This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Do not get the basic double room it is a utility room sharing a wall with the lift shaft Worst hotel I have stayed in Bea the reception was extremely rude and in my opinion really needs some lessons in customer service Shower was broken Tv was broken No massage available even though it says on website No parking available even though it says on website
Henry VIII, See above 
Henry VIII, Very poor in need of refurbishment The pool had no changing rooms The sauna didn t work The heating in the bedroom didn t work The hotel had no supervisor or manager a young lady was running the hotel alone very unsafe in event of a fire etc We left early due to the experience The hotel cost was refunded after various arguments with the lady who couldn t contact the manager who was in Spain 
Henry VIII, The d cor was drab and grubby the photo s on the website must have been taken 10 years ago The aircon didn t work in the room which left a small radiator for the only source of heat The cleaners left the window open so on return the room was freezing The breakfast was of average the bacon and sausages were obviously a very cheap brand The eggs only offered scrambled were like rubber All in all a very disappointing stay I will not be returning 
Henry VIII, Bed pillows stair carpet needs replacing Round the pool needs deep clean carpet upholstery in dining room need clean 
Henry VIII, free room wifi did not work well
Henry VIII, Henrys bar was awful selection of drinks were pretty non existent barman was helpful but not able to help us Bathroom needed some tlc especially the shower and the loo roll holder was hanging off the wall 
Henry VIII, The receptionist was extremely helpful but other than that the hotel is more like a 2 star The supposedly superior room was very cramped carpet stained and floorboards creaked non stop The curtains didn t close properly and the view looked onto someone s bedroom The television did not work and as my room adjoined reception I could hear music and people coming and going I returned to the hotel in the evening and there were several make guests drinking outside this gave the impression of a DSS halfway house Certainly for a lone female guest not at all reassuring about safety Breakfast food was cold and generally school dinner like A woeful experience
Henry VIII, Decor a bit dated and tired
Henry VIII, Kiwis at breakfast sliced awkwardly to eat if nit picking Place could do with new carpets and sofas in entrance but overall good stay
Henry VIII, Very small double room 8 m2 with a not good closing bathroomdoor bathroom even without ventilation Room was above the general airco machine so impossible to open the window too noisy Tv was not working
Henry VIII, Bar poorly stocked bar staff not good room was cold room was too light due to the street lights not being blocked out by curtains tv didn t work and staff were dismissive of this and unable unwilling to help
Henry VIII, There were some cultural differences I think arising from the fact that the owning company is Spanish as most of the staff seem to be One as I have seen in another review that whilst there is a hot food selection for breakfast sausages scrambled eggs bacon beans every day that food though good quality was no more than luke warm I asked if there was a bar and was told it was open from 8pm until 11 When I went there it was the breakfast room was in dimmed light with one attendant at the other end of the room She came to see what I wanted but didn t speak a word of English She showed me a drinks menu and I managed to buy a drink But I don t think that it s what most UK people would expect when they say they have a bar 
Henry VIII, We used the staircase rather than the lift and noticed that this area could do with a lick of paint 
Henry VIII, I secretly notified the hotel it was my husband s birthday they said they would put something special in the room This did not happen The staff were all foreign and seemed at times to lack in understanding The rooms were also rather small but adequate for one night 
Henry VIII, Bar not much variety and could not get a nice coffee latte hot chocolate in the evening at the bar 
Henry VIII, No bath plug Non attentive bar staff Hardly spoke English Stains on bed linen Air con not working Room was separated only by party door Pool tiny
Henry VIII, I like an electric supply near my bed as my phone acts as my alarm clock but the nearest one was on the other side of the room One other thing the oldest staff member I saw was in her late twenties I wonder how many employees are unpaid interns 
Henry VIII, Everything is just short of being good breakfast is ok but quality is standard nothing of high standards sauna is there but is tiny and not so hot rooms are ok but quite small so leaves a strange feeling of almost being there but in the end rather standard 
Henry VIII, Breakfast wasn t great but there are lots of nice places for breakfast on the same road 
Henry VIII, The room was ridiculously small and I could literally hear people talking in next door room It did not worth the money at all The staff were not friendly and overall I do not recommend this hotel 
Henry VIII, Could clearly hear Tube trains every few minutes Door to swimming pool difficult to open No changing facilities at pool and no information given to suggest changing in own room Room was very small could only get in the double bed from one side 
Henry VIII, At breakfast you need to gaurd your table l had finished my cereal went to get some toast by the time I had returned the table had been cleared and other guests had been seated when I complained to the waitress s they seemed to think it was my fault when a simple sorry would have been a more acceptable outcome
Henry VIII, Small rooms but I had read this on reviews I still booked as the added perk with pool for me and my daughter sold it to me For the price was worth it 
Henry VIII, Don t have a room front of the hotel because the bin men make quite a lot of noise from around five pm carpets were tired 
Henry VIII, For starters the reception staff do not speak English In London Noisy rooms from the lift all night TVs that don t work and beds and pillows from Henry s days Don t expect much from this place and you won t be disappointed 
Henry VIII, Room doors are exceptionally loud not because guests slam them but because they are heavy and poorly adjusted Constant noise of loud doors This was my only complaint with this otherwise more than satisfactory hotel 
Henry VIII, The cooked breakfast wasn t very nice at all And everyone seems to stare at you when you go down for breakfast 
Henry VIII, The rooms too small We can hear our neighbor easily
Henry VIII, Do they realise that in the pool changing rooms the curtains are white and you can see everthing through them Can be very embarrassing when people are changing
Henry VIII, On a Saturday breakfast room was full I got seated went to make a drink and they had sat someone else in my seat I took another got a cup of tea then went to get breakfast Came back and they cleared my tea and table I told the staff but the English wasn t good and she brought me back a ruined drink I said no and she just ran away Double room super tiny 
Henry VIII, Only quibble was our room was right opposite the lift so a little noisy but otherwise great hotel 
Henry VIII, The reception is a little shabby but rooms are clean and all you need 
Henry VIII, My room was awful Situated on the ground floor near the main road so I was disturbed by traffic Rooms are also poorly insulated so could hear noise from upstairs and in the hotel lobby
Henry VIII, obviously had a very good photographer because the rooms are nothing like the pics My single room was hot and stuffy in December with an ineffective and loud fan In the end I opened the window Tiny bed even for a single Breakfast buffet had run out when I got there had to wait 15 mins for more Dirty stained chairs in the dining room and staff that did the bare minimum and no more There are better hotels in London for the money and I ve stayed in lots of them Avoid 
Henry VIII, Is this hotel rated 4 They put us opposite the lift and it was too noisy going up and down the small balcony is full of people talking and can see them outside our window which is just a meter away and it was past midnight and we could not even sleep The room is jam packed with furniture and no enough space to walk around but oblige to sit in bed End up leaving the hotel too early 
Henry VIII, ppl staying next door kept making noise the whole morning by slamming the door and talked very loud outside my bedroom 
Henry VIII, The room was small but it didn t bother us too much as we didn t send much time in the hotel we just slept there 
Henry VIII, Carpets in corridors and at the reception need cleaning or replacing Unfortunately they make place look shabby 
Henry VIII, sauna is large enough for one person only two if you have a close friend interconnecting door to next room is very thin and no sound proofing could hear someone coughing all night and every word of their conversation Breakfast was cold and the breakfast staff not very attentive 
Henry VIII, every thing is great breakfast is fantastic the staff are so friendly and more than nice location is near city center but quite and very safe One can t ask for more 
Henry VIII, Scrambled eggs were awful But in general the breakfast was quite good and lots of it The carpet on the stairs is very warn Especially between ground and first floor We requested a room on a high floor but unfortunately were given a room on the first floor looking out on a roof other building but we were only staying for 2 nights so didn t ask to change It was just the ordinary double room that we booked anyway 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Nothing all excellent
Henry VIII, Property looked nothing like in the picture Maybe it looked like this 10 years ago Staff is quite rood not everyone Very unprofessional behaviour of one of the receptionists Breakfast salami was smeling and tasting like it was out of date Would not recommend
Henry VIII, Had to wait a long time for items to be topped up at breakfast Something food or drink had splashed on wall in restaurant and not been cleaned right 
Henry VIII, Complained at size room for 4 star hotel Only window broken in two places right across pane and bathroom fan not operational Breakfast poor cold and some empty 
Henry VIII, The rooms are very small Internet service was temperamental I had to log on frequently 
Henry VIII, Incredibly noisy room awake for hours because of it Staff didn t know why probably room close to the lift shaft or a large air con unit Not great if you need sleep and have to work the next day 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, 1 The air conditioner was not working 2 The shower soap tray was underneath the water outlet limiting the space and causing accidental collision that hurt my arm 3 The shower soap tray was loose and falling apart 4 One of the coffee machines was not working queuing people to make coffee during breakfasts 
Henry VIII, made an error boooking and explained it per emil the direction did even not take the time to consider and gave a stereotyp answer I was awar of the conditions and this answer that is why I made a personal request so I had to pay one false booked night for a room I coumd no utilise the direction even did not propose half a solution this will prevent me from staying in Henry viii again and also I wwill NOT recommend it to my Luxembourg grman or french friends This is a pity as I stay at least times a year in London and my friends even more and we are always looking for a nice hotel with is worth it s price qhqnery viii was my favorite ludovicy danielle booking made for my daughters ROEF Claire and Nina
Henry VIII, The room was tiny the walls were paper thin We could clearly hear guests in the next room talking Very difficult to sleep because of this 
Henry VIII, Third or fourth time staying here and the wifi is dreadful Rooms are ridiculously small even a hobbit would have trouble manoeuvring Breakfast anaemic fried foods tasteless watery poured off filtered off someone s boots Overpriced and underperforming hotel 
Henry VIII, Rooms are small and very squeaky floorboards You can hear people moving around next door and talking in the corridor but we spent very little time in the room 
Henry VIII, Despite other reviews this hotel is really good value for location aside from the breakfast Breakfast was the worst hotel breakfast conti or cooked I ve ever had Powered egg and long life pastries 
Henry VIII, Room very small and very cheap fittings Beds terrible Smallest bathroom I have ever seen Noise from trains every few minutes Breakfast inedible 
Henry VIII, Horrible location felt vulnerable as a single lady D cor old shabby and room cramped and uncomfortable not at all like the photo s on the web 
Henry VIII, The room wasn t that big however for us that wasn t a problem The only thing about this was that you don t have a normal door to the bathroom so you can hear all the strange noises in the room The TV could have been bigger nevertheless you most likely don t use it that much 
Henry VIII, Rooms are really small which was little bit inconvenient and most importantly wifi was not good enough for basic connection I found much better hotel and better price than this hotel 
Henry VIII, Quality of room small awful old furniture it was a attic corner room with stairs tiny stunk of tobacco 
Henry VIII, Rooms too small Not a 4 star hotel as advertised Very disappointed First room we were given was already occupied by someone else door did not shut on bathroom i would not recommend this hotel 
Henry VIII, Some of the rooms are a little on the small side although the staff did their best to find us a larger room thank you 
Henry VIII, The lobby and our room were very smokey People smoked below our window The staff did move us which improved it Our room was very small Breakfast was ok but nor great
Henry VIII, The hotel was too old the room was small without fridge in the breakfast was poor we tried to call 4 times in reception but doesn t work

Henry VIII, The room was very small and despite requesting a quiet room we were put in a room above the tube line Fortunately we didn t spend a great deal of time in the hotel so it served our purpose Avoid room 401 
Henry VIII, The room was very small and not really worth the price so I presume we were paying for the location although it was clean The carpets were tatty and the lifts were slow and very small 
Henry VIII,No Negative
Henry VIII, Dimly lit corridors with inadequate safety signage on steps caused me to have an accident during my stay Staff were ill equipped to deal with this and did not speak very good English 
Henry VIII, Stayed at back of hotel which was noisy from trains very disappointed that the leisure facilities promised were not available

Henry VIII, The filth
Henry VIII, The decor was tired and dated and the room was cramped and very small for the nightly rate The room was above a railway line which was quite noisy 
Henry VIII, In all my years of travelling and staying at hotels I have never in my life written a review I was so shocked by this stay that I cannot stress enough how awful it was Do not stay here fellow travellers In rating itself as a 4 star hotel I think the establishment missed an S in it s title This hotel is much more like a HOSTEL Had I known it would be a dump I would ve been happy as my expectations were managed I cannot believe this hotel hasn t gotten away with rating itself as a 4 star hotel My studio flat in London seemed palatial in comparison And having thought I d treat myself to a hotel stay in my city I couldn t run back to my place fast enough Their mantra should be We don t do it here We don t offer room service They don t offer room service on weekends Did you get that On weekends zero room service Instead they shoved a take away flyer under a guest s nose saying they should order take away from a local place and hope they deliver We don t do space The room is equivalent to a private hostel room the bed shoved in one corner with a tiny desk next to it and one window My companion and I literally had to walk out of the room to allow the other in To say the rooms are TINY is an understatement We don t offer hand soap Yep no hand soap had to use shower gel to wash my hands in a bathroom the equivalent of a toilet stall We don t care that you have mistaken the TV for a CCTV camera The flat screen TV is so small that you miss it the first time I d have taken a TV from the 1980 s rather than strain to see a picture from box that is smaller than most people s laptops We don t operate working lifts yep No lift In a 4 star hotel we had to take the stairs We don t provide deck chairs or towels their basement pool is ok but they only have 2 deck chairs 
Henry VIII, Rooms were incredibly small to warrant such a star rating It is a very basic hotel It is dirty and tatty The pool is not clean with the surrounding surfaces being very grimy

Henry VIII, Don t take room 500 trains right under the hotel and finish passing at midnight and starts in the morning Cracked window Water in shower without pression Reception told me u had an upgrade maybe because it was a triple instead of a double so there was more space but was the only room facing the underground lines on the 5th floor The house keepers should wait a minute after they knock at the door before they go in 
Henry VIII, Room and Bed is unbelibably small It was double bed room but I think the room bed is not enought to use for one person Even there is no space to open keep my luggage And the bed is just little bit more bigger than single bed

Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Had difficulties finding parking in the neighbourhood
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room was definitely not 4 stars hotel Type especially beds and covers on them Quality of pillows was really bad Room itself was very old and Carpet on the room stairways was in so bad condition This hotel or probably different rooms must be renewed but I don t think that will be performed So the hotel must be 2 or 3 stars maximum in the rating according my travel experience 
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room too small wifi has no signal at all short breakfast no parking for the car rooms in a separated building has to cross a n ugly open air area to get the room 
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, The area wasn t the best Staff on breakfast on one morning weren t very nice Eggs were finished 20 mins before breakfast end and was very hesitant to make him more It was 35 37 degrees Celsius during Our Stay and there was little to no air conditioning

Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Room hadn t been used in some time hair in bath and dust all over the TV several things in the room that did not work lights in bathroom mirror light etc heating was only set to 10 c when we arrived in the room etc In the room we had 3rd floor the mattresses are very old and the double bed is two singles impossible to sleep in the middle Wifi doesn t work very well on the 3rd floor Even though we are aware we booked a special promotional price we were expecting more from a 4 star hotel 
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, very small room but it is rather typical for Paris the cleanness was so so access to metro is fine if you don t carry heavy stuff I would appreciate segreggation of garbage especially as Paris hosted COP21 at that time
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, Morning stuff unpleasent to deal with Temperature in the hotel was way too high from the hall to the room In the room there was no option to decrease the temperature as the heating was switched off and temperature was around 25 26 because of it it was diffucult to sleep and get ready in the morning
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, This hotel is dirty and multiple rooms are bug infested My bed had many bugs in it I got horrible bites all over my face and on my back only from being in this bed for about 15 minutes before I saw the bugs The toilet jammed almost every time I flashed spilling water on the bathroom floor Wi fi in rooms not working no reach The rooms as well as the lobby are dark and depressing hotel staff does not speak sufficient English language to help the guests with many simple issues The experience from day 1 was very aggravating and disappointing I was Paris in business attending important event and meeting many business partners Too bad I had to attend all meetings with burning red swollen face from the bugs bites Disgusting and unbelievable I would like this review to be a warning to other people considering their stay at Villa Lutece bugs were found in more rooms another colleague who was staying in a different room on a different floor was bitten too This is below any standard and the 4 stars which this hotel claims are absolutely not deserved and do not reflect the reality 
Villa Lut ce Port Royal, The staff were not friendly at all One old guy sitting on the reception with food in his mouth had no customer skills that was the instant bad impression Room are totally not like what they look like in the pictures They literally feel and looked dirty Rooms are very small not worth the money at all corridors are covered with red carpet and dirt shows on the even a blind person can see it Same is with the door locks If u touch then please please please wash your hands after The hotel does not give u comfort or safe feeling on the contrary u feel scared and insecure They dont even have free cancilation They should have it because after entering the hotel and see the bad customer service almost every one with right mind would want to walk out of that place I guess they know this that is the reason they dont have free cancellation services This hotel in perticulerly spoiled my trip and the image of paris forever for me Please please please people be carefull this place is not worth it at all There is many other places batter then this 100 times on cheeper prices Stay away from this place

Gran Hotel Barcino, You can only buy coffee in the vending machine it s not very good Late check in 14 00 No good cosmetics in the bathroom just simple shower gel 
Gran Hotel Barcino, We would have liked tea coffee machine in the room The bathroom shower needs attention 
Gran Hotel Barcino, There was a lot of noise at night and also the hotel had a strange smell inside due to its ancient furnitures maybe But it was close to the center and the metro 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Window does not close properly so a lot of noise from outside travels through to inside the room and could not sleep well There are 2 euro per night for security box 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Bath was old and grubby I put a Shirt in for ironing at 10 15am the cut off time for that day was 10 30am it should of bin back to the Hotel for 7pm it never arived back till 8 15pm I had a table booked at a Tapas bar for 7 30pm wich I lost my advise is don t use this service
Gran Hotel Barcino, Stuff was not friendly nor effective nor responsible the room was really small the shower gel shampoo was not added after one day of stay and the quantity of if at the beginning was very small 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Lots of outdated hardware Elevator a bit rickety dark corridir lights as you advance along but too slowly Bed covers looked shabby felt prickly had some holes in them A missing corner in a floor tile Room 403 But top of the negatives was the hardly lukewarm water in the shower my 12yo wouldn t have it so went unshowered to the airport 
Gran Hotel Barcino, No drinking water no tooth brash no lotion very old shower towels uncomfortable bed very bad and old blankets without cover no slippers no kettle no glasses no soundproofing dark corridors no climate control It s not at all like 4 stars hotel 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel internet was very bad the rooms are very very hot the rooms are very dark no sunshine comes ever In the toilet we saw 2 insects the stuff of hotel is not so kind I can only say good words for this hotel is the location unfotunately I am not advicing this hotel 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Staff again some of the people working there should probably do something else unfriendly and kind of arrogant also if you work in the reception don t stand in the entrance and smoke Kind of basic hotel dosen t feels like 4 stars
Gran Hotel Barcino, I was forced to pay for a breakfast more than I had Due to booking made on 2 vouchers paid by 2 different creditcards The breakfast was paid on one voucher but could only be used that day not the next This is not a Hotel with any etics or it is very poorly managed or mayby in financial trouble since they must trick their guests like this They get their money for booking com but it is lost for the guest because it was on the wrong voucher Don t book in this hotel 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Curtains need to be darker to block light and sound out Steps down to my room with heavy suitcases not great 
Gran Hotel Barcino, The breakfast could be more fresh like coffee could be man made and not from machine fresh orange juice etc 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Nothing good really in the hotel plenty of good breakfast places around the area Smelly room noicy hotel got their stars probably 20 years ago when they did the last renovation I wouldn t book it again 
Gran Hotel Barcino, A To reach the lift we need to use stairs With big suitcase was not easy Nobody help us B The clima was out of order even after we inform them C The windows balcony door was simply so we heard all outside noise we feel that we sleep in the street D The payment was made 100 one day before arrival All fees must be pay at arrival Is unusual when they heve as guaranti my credit card 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel is less than its star rating Extremely poor customer service I got charged twice and went through hell to get a refund The rooms are just okay with a lot of ants 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Staff during evening and nightime unfriendly Wifi mentioned doesn t work Bathroom sinks stucked didn t even say sorry nor didn t fix it
Gran Hotel Barcino, The work of hotel personal are bad organised and not professional especially by job handover They gave keys of a room to different guestes on same day and doubt the guest entered wrong room They didn t have apologise and were impolite The room were not cleaned in time 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Decor very very outdated something from the 80 s Breakfast awful and inedible Very noisy during the night 
Gran Hotel Barcino, It look 20 mins to check in cause the guy at desk was barely moving and picked his nose while checking us in The room was meant to be 2 singles but we got a double and were told we had no choice but we had booked 2 singles The room was really dated and just unkept The bed was just disgusting and smelly The room had no air con and no tv signal Overall a terrible hotel and should be removed from booking Com
Gran Hotel Barcino, Everything But more specifically the room smelled horrible when we arrived It was a hot day and after failing to figure out how to turn on the air conditioning which is promised as an amenity we asked the staff to help us They were very rude and told us there could be no air conditioning until next month We tried to make the room comfortable by opening the window but it was still very hot and the sounds of the city were obnoxious This hotel should not be listed as a place to do business with on booking com or any other site 
Gran Hotel Barcino,No Negative
Gran Hotel Barcino, I asked not to charge the credit card before arriving in order to pay in cash This was an option given during the booking process The hotel charged the credit card before I arrived
Gran Hotel Barcino, Very unpleasant experience dingy rooms and moldy bathrooms holes in curtains window which can not be closed Very loud noise from outside No real willingness to help from staff Poor breakfast no vegetables only paprika 
Gran Hotel Barcino, We booked a triple room and it was basically just a twin room with a camp bed squeezed in Wasn t a major issue as it was just somewhere to sleep but the beds were pretty much joined together with a narrow space to walk round Not too bad but wouldn t go out of my to stay there again 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Worst hotel experience i had first of all the room was filthy dirty floor ugly smell and never cleaned under the matress i work as a hotel manager and i know where to look to bad for them very poor customer service with untrained staff i was double charged for the stay so i had to deal with booking com to get my money back they even told that i was lying but luckly i kept the receipt Anyway very inconfortable stay pillows felt like rocks the bedding was damp and probably from previous stay for the price i paid of 65 euro you wouldn expect much but the staff was so rude and i never get an apology for the double charge n my opinion booking com should stop making bussinnes with this hotel
Gran Hotel Barcino, At the time of the booking we were promised a room of a certain size and standard Upon arrival we were given the smallest room ever with the window facing a narrow shaft Hardly any day light Except for the twin bed there was not enough space to unpack the suitcases I had to make a lot of fuss to get a new room of the agreed size and standard 
Gran Hotel Barcino, The hotel was under construction The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room s window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm So we couldn t take a nap from time to time when we needed it I have to add that when I ordered the room from booking they didn t mention that the hotel was under construction When I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said I m sorry but I have nothing to do It will last for 2 more days Of course the construction works didn t end but continued all week Also I wouldn t recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience 
Gran Hotel Barcino, It was hard to find the hair dryer it was in a drawer that looked like a towel rack and the shampoo soap etc was very small There was a door stopper in the floor which was by the luggage bench so every time you went to your luggage you stubbed your toe plus no US plugs the hotel did supply 1 adapter for our use 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel is good but I paid twice First I paid after arrival later my credit card was charged Management informed but they deny Require invoice immediately 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Old furniture and d cor Squeaky bed No mini bar Noise from the street Miscommunication over breakfast We had paid for breakfast on booking the room but were refused entry as on the hotel records breakfast was excluded for our stay But we spoke to the receptionist and finally we were allowed to eat 
Gran Hotel Barcino, Dreadful place Was traveling with two grown sons and had requested three beds First room they put us in had two poor beds and a very sad cot Ceiling was low and A C was close to non existent Phone didn t initially work Wifi didn t work in that area of the property Asked to be moved but had to wait until second day to be moved in slightly better room with still terrible third bed Better wifi but still poor A C In both rooms we literally moved all of the furniture to put my poor middle aged head directly until the A C vent so that I d survive Desk staff mostly unpleasant bordering on surly Not particularly clean including water stained ceiling tiles and rust stains Tiles need grout and too few towels which were slightly raggedy and scratchy How many characters do I get because I can go on Spent part of one night in lobby just because of the A C Fold out chair that functioned a third bed shaped like a child s roller coast ups and downs When we checked out there was no one at the desk found our own taxi My son only told me on the last day that his sheets had sand in them sand from him but they didn t bother to change 
Gran Hotel Barcino, The payment was deducted from my debit card before I arrived which was not pay later as I thought it was Secondly there is a damp smell when you enter the lobby Also the bed covers are not appealing
Gran Hotel Barcino, Big room but the bed was 135cm and I am used to 180 Decoration might need an update

London Elizabeth Hotel, Not sure where to start The Hotel from the outside looked lovely Reception looked nice Staff OK We had heavy luggage and were advised to use the lift You were lucky if you can fit a suitcase in this lift it was the size of a single wardrobe The room was Outdated No Air Con No batteries in remote control no tea bags and one milk for two We have travelled and stayed in many places this has to be by far the worst Very over priced for what was there we certainly did not want to stay for breakfast 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The Wifi was a bit too slow 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Tiny hot room space Only lift was so small 2 of us plus a bag apiece felt like sardines in a tin 
London Elizabeth Hotel, It was cheap Everything was disappointing No lock up area for luggage Lift had room for 2 small people and was very slow My room on the first floor was poorly furnished had no hot water and was directly over a bus stop Aircon was broken Just don t bother Life is too short One of the worst I have ever stayed in 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Entered room to find tv on loud with no remote to switch it off Also noticed that despite 30 degrees outside the towel rail was on full heat in the bathroom and could not be turned off Lady on reception was helpful in bring a remote control and trying to contact the maintenance guy but he was apparently ignoring her calls and hung up when she contacted him on her own mobile Were there two days and did not get it fixed Suggest hotel re considers who is doing the maintenance Despite the fancy box of teas in the room the two milk cartons and the breakfast tea bag we used on the first night were not replaced so reception had to come up with a small jug of milk and my partner and I shared the remaining tea bag on the following morning Would have preferred this instead of the fancy handy mobile phone available for guests to use although this was obviously aimed at the international visitor Get the basics right first 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Decor and breakfast
London Elizabeth Hotel, Was great no probs
London Elizabeth Hotel, No welcome drink Frosty welcome from receptionist who was complaining about another customer unprofessional Lift not working No room service at night reception call for takeaway that took over an hour Peeling paint in room Expensive in room snacks out of date Limited expensive bar drinks Neglected facilities Noisy cleaners in corridor early in morning 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Scruffy public areas Bathroom tatty Tiny lift inevitable in old building or long staircase to 4th floor Fairly chaotic check in out Small breakfast area 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The Room was uncomfortably hot and we were not able to sleep all night I had expected an air conditioned room in a four star hotel in fact there was a small ceiling fan providing some air to the feet of the bed beds were too small The carpets were old and seem unclean The breakfast was the worst I have seen from all the hotels booked to booking com The continental breakfast offered some cereals apples boiled egg and cold toasts I will write to you separately requesting for refund because the hotel was not in my opinion a four star accommodation There were at least two guests I met who very upset about the poor the quality of service I requested a table fan during the night because I was unable to sleep but there were none available It appears that even for the guests who have air conditioned rooms the air conditioning has malfunctioned I believe that considering that this was rated as four star it should have been made clear to the guests that in the heat of the summer no air conditioned rooms will be available I would rate our stay at this hotel is the worst experience ever
London Elizabeth Hotel, First gripe the TINY lift My daughter refused point blank to get in it with me and our two suitcases to be fair it would have been a tight squeeze We actually only ever used it going up to our room on the third floor with shopping we always came down on the stairs BUT it is vital for those checking out for bringing heavy luggage down to reception I found that in the mornings it was often blocked with individual guests using it to go down for breakfast while other guests were left waiting on landings with luggage Second gripe breakfast Breakfast was included in the deal I got for our stay so this gripe is NOT personal and to be honest we decided beforehand to have breakfast each day on our way to whatever attraction we had planned most in London open at 10 00 The hotel breakfast is a continental one and this is advertised as such the dining area is small and there is an obvious rush hour at peak times so I would be very annoyed if I actually had to pay for it I would go down between 07 30 and 08 00 and just take an orange juice and coffee to the bar to read the news online many times there were people complaining about the wait to get tables or the lack of food when they got there When in London you are never far away from a proper English breakfast for a very reasonable price Location was what sold this hotel to me 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The elevator is tiny max two people or one with a piece of luggage So for a family with three bags they will need to do it on 3 4 rounds The cleanliness of the room was not up to my expectations They don t refill shampoos and toiletries when used There is no don t disturb sign to post on your door The breakfast is very poor On some corn flakes and coffee 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was very out dated Shower barely worked Room just about fitted the double bed in it Could have got the same in a B B Bed for one night at budget price for gig at Hyde Park Anything more and there would have been a complaint for sure 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything was perfect Basic continental breakfast only 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The breakfast was pretty poor hard bread and very little choice Complimentary tea and coffee was minimum 3 of us in the room with only 2 Breakfast Teas and 2 milks and one packet of biscuits trivial point I know
London Elizabeth Hotel, Poor staff relations at reception and at breakfast Room dull dated floor not level particularly in bathroom Complimentary tea coffee making items not adequate nor replaced on second day Breakfast very basic eg basket of cold toast fresh fruit wrinkled and some showing rot Tea in a large thermos tasted of coffee Overall no value for money Sentiment shared by many guests We were very disappointed with our choice of this property for our last two nights of a wonderful 46 day UK holiday 
London Elizabeth Hotel,No Negative
London Elizabeth Hotel, They did not inform about a major renovation of the roads just outside of the hotel with a number of heavy machines starting unnecessary early their work and making it impossible to sleep any longer and certainly difficult to work from the room during daytime On top of this they did not inform that the TUBE station Lancaster gate very close to the hotel and the main reason for me to choose the hotel was closed for renovation and had been since January Booking com and the hotel could easily have informed of these important facts and thereby avoided dissatiesfied customers Trust in the booking com service build up over years of positive use is easily eroded in such instances I asked for a rebate but was denied they did change my room to the back side though I asked for them to cancel and refund the second of two nights but was denied this as well 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Extremely uncaring and conceited staff apart from one girl The receptionist meeting us kept measuring us up and we didn t feel welcome at all Once we d entered the hotel corridors we realized they ve put all their money into the lobby The hotel corridors where extremely narrow the lift only fitted one normal size person and one suitcase or two normal sized people The further we went into the hotel the shabbier it got A damp smell of mold caused headaches and it wasn t exactly inviting to a good night sleep Some paint might have covered up some of the worst parts but again they d probably just repaint the lobby instead though I doubt it would cover up dodgy and badly kept corridors floors and walls We ve booked a room with one double bed and a single bed family of 3 but received a room with two single beds and an extra bed We decided to stay after all as we where very tired In the middle of the night we were woken up by a dripping sound and saw water coming down from the ceiling This would explain the very bumpy and uneven floor I suspect the bathroom above us had a leak and probably not for the first time My husband but a bin under it and rushed down to the reception to let them know it was a leak and all they did was to hand him the key to the room next door No assistance in getting us there no rushing to fix the room and no staff coming to ask if we were installed alright in the new room Even worse the snotty receptionist didn t mention this when checking out no apology or even acknowledgment when we told her that we would check out from a different room than the one we checked out from and we told her kindly why Oh OK was all we got The breakfast is a different story Simple continental breakfast with more cakes than food bad coffee and the self service bar was put in a narrow hallway not big enough for two to serve themselves at the time DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE PICTURES 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Continental breakfast poor local tube not working shame as was using as a base not hotels fault I know but wish had known about it pleasant but not outstanding have some nice pictures of rooms on their site shame wasn t in one ok for stop over some good restaurants nearby
London Elizabeth Hotel, The interior is a bit run down cracked bathroom tiles very old and worn carpets scratched woodwork but functional The room was crammed with furniture so I could hardly move but that is common in central London 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The interiors were a little old but staff were so friendly and the food very tasty from
London Elizabeth Hotel, The ceiling fan didn t work so the room was quite hot at times the receptionist didn t seem that bothered when I mentioned this to her Some of the breakfast pastries didn t seem very fresh Very small lift 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The bath tub was deeper than customary in USA It did not have grab bars or or anything else to hang on to when getting on or out for showering 
London Elizabeth Hotel, 4 Maybe 20 years ago It was verry cold in the room I think colder than outside Breakfast A good joke Maybe ok for 1 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Wifi was very slow both in room and reception BREAKFAST WAS A JOKE No variety at all no charcuterie at all lowest quality croissants to laugh at Hotel promots a la carte breakfast although regular included which was poor also Staff not always very polite There is an allegedly persian restaurant in the same place didn t dare it because of the breakfast frustration 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Due to the age of the building the sound insulation was appalling and we were woken by an adjacent room s occupant s alarm clock at a ridiculous hour 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Apart from the bathroom I personally like this quaint little room My husband did not because it was too dark It had a sofa that needed a good clean or new covers but otherwise it was fine Reception staff were under pressure and we had to wait to book in even though our room was ready Others who arrived were not so lucky 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The tube station opposite the hotel was closed for renovation Not a big issue since there were excellent buses just outside the hotell instead 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Rooms were very noisy we could loudly hear the traffic outside our neighbors and when someone was walking upstairs The first family room we had 340 was very run down the next room we got 339 was slightly better but still very dated The shower barely worked in our first room The carpets were dirty The outside of the hotel as well as the reception looks very nice But once inside the corridors and the rooms everything is very run downed and dated This hotel is in dire need of a complete makeover I guess this is a very typical Victorian London Hotel 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The wifi was very slow and the hotel furnishings fixtures etc was quite old and a bit shabby Also the window in my room was letting in a bit of a draft and the heat didn t work one night of my stay but they did apologize for this Admittedly I should have reported it as soon as I realized it instead I kept waiting and waiting for it to kick on and it didn t and I just went to sleep The continental breakfast wasn t stellar I ended up just eating a bowl of cereal both mornings but this is par for the course Warning you have to leave your room key when you leave the hotel and when I came back one afternoon I accidentally asked for the wrong room key I was room 335 and I asked for 333 by mistake It was given to me no questions asked no form of ID or checks whatsoever were required to get the room key and I could ve gone into that wrong room and stolen something I realized quite quickly BEFORE going into the wrong room that I didn t have my own key and got the right one but it made me very uncomfortable to think that someone could have done the same thing to my room and stolen my things 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Untrained staff water leak from room above into our room Felt as if owner just wanted to make money out of asset without thinking about providing service
London Elizabeth Hotel, If the room had been for 2 people it would have been very squashed 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Continental breakfast was poor The lift is a bit small two people but how they fix that is not obvious 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Double bed was not a double bed It was a 4ft room floor was slopping Room very small Shower either very very hot or not very warm at all 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The room desperately needs redecoration The station at Lancaster Gate is closed until July Breakfast totally unimaginative Although advertised in the smokers united site as a hotel with available smoking rooms the staff insisted that all their rooms are non smoking 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Rooms could be cleaner esp the bathroom with cracked basin and black round the tiles in the shower Curtains sagged from rail and everything was extremely tatty 
London Elizabeth Hotel, After upgrading the breakfast did not expect to pay a service charge What was the service charge for Already paid for the service you would have thought when booking hot water only just warm radiator in room didn t work did not fix it when told but put a small heater fan in room 
London Elizabeth Hotel, No hot water for morning shower 3 days in a row No wifi for 3 days and nights Booked a double bed and got a room with three single beds When I spoke to manager said that they were fully booked and that was all they could give me I asked for a refund but they refused to give me one Tube station 100 yards away is being repaited until July 2016 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Bathroom tiles standard of finish could benefit from some attention Continental breakfast selection very limited 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Carpets a little tired not a huge choice at breakfast Very nice bread and of course given location marmelade but no jam Cheese but no ham Porridge was cold A cooked breakfast was available for extra 10 Some refurbishment and a more extensive breakfast selection included in the room price and this would be pretty perfect 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything else was from bad to strictly ok Breakfast was pathetic stale and wrongly described Staff was largely mid leading Some might have been trying to be helpful but completely contrasting information by others Booking com s lowest score for a review is 2 5 which is highly misleading 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Very Small room Small bed Some lights didn t work Freezing room as the heating didn t work Drafty windows Cold Shower which needs re tiling The corridors are narrow noisy guests banging doors all night Breakfast OK if you like cheese Bar very dark no atmosphere Flat beer and expensive We had a wonderful view of the rear car park Spoilt my trip completely 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel is quite old style hot water system had an issue for 1 day the breakfast continental is not including a large variety of food it is pretty basic indeed 
London Elizabeth Hotel, No hot water for the duration of my stay and no form of compensation offered Although the staff were friendly it didn t make up for a freezing shower in the morning The internet provided was horrendously slow and pointless even trying to connect 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel was dated and didn t look like photos especially bedrooms which were small dirty and in need of some repair 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Everything else Staff very unfriendly and not welcoming Furniture old and damaged Toilet in room did not flush hair in showerhead old and dirty carpet in the room 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was very tired with facilities jammed in together that clearly weren t all meant to be together
London Elizabeth Hotel, Breakfast poor compared with previous visits No menus no descriptions Car parking charge has more than doubled in four years 
London Elizabeth Hotel, My room and shower room needs I refurbishment
London Elizabeth Hotel, elevator very narrow and inconvenient small voices from the floor very old building iteruppted WIFI not nice breakfast no hot water available all time old keys should be dropped to reception the building is overall very old and need expansion with mentainance
London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel overall temperature is far too uncomfortably hot Continental breakfast is very basic and limited Lift is too small 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Furniture tatty no heating in bathroom hot water only look warm Cups for Tea and Coffee in the room dirty Staff arguing with each other at the front desk
London Elizabeth Hotel, The continental breakfast is quite poor althoug the staff is very attentive the choice for breakfast is not big unless you count cake and tarts as breakfast too The bar on the ground floor looks more like a provisional solution and the choice of drinks is quite small some more comfortable sofas would change already the whole ambience The water pressure in the shower on the 4th floor is quite weak 
London Elizabeth Hotel, An unloved hotel Full of character but needs some investment and TLC Elegant reception is not matched by the mediocre rooms Such a waste of potential 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The room was noisy from an extractor fan or something This went on nearly throughout the night The bathroom was poor with a lot of broken tiles and a huge crack through the incredibly small bath Breakfast simply didn t bother with this on the second morning as it was really limited 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Room next to the lift was not ideal but not a major problem 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Having booked and paid in advance for a deluxe double we were put in a shabby basement room which looked like a 1970 s guest house Stressed and unhelpful reception staff were not prepared able to give us another room and blamed booking com for getting the reservation wrong In our experience this is definitely NOT A 4star hotel 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Hotel was dirty and very poorly maintained The staff were rude and the reception was not aware of the details of our booking Nobody helped us with our luggage or offered to at any point Both breakfast and dinner were poor at best We had taken an offer for 20 person for dinner they offered us their ala cart dinner which was advertised at 15 person at the hotel Needless to say I felt cheated Definitely not staying there again 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The receptionist was not at all welcoming We were not introduced to the breakfast system simply shown to our seats and left to watch and learn from everyone else Toast was not offered we had to ask and wait quite a while for it to be delivered to our table The room was cold I would have expected the heating to have been on at the end of October
London Elizabeth Hotel, Two single beds were very narrow Smallest elevator in the world 1 person or two suitcases Continental breakfast adaquate no meats
London Elizabeth Hotel, No help with baggage an elevator which is slow used by staff and guests alike and only hods 2 passengers or one with much baggage The bathrooms are tired need paint grout and handles to hold too when getting in or out of deep tubs to have a shower The price differential on the rooms over a 4 day stay was huge 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel needs shutting and refurbished is in a bad state we were moved rooms when the tiles fell off the wall nearly hitting my wife in the bath Staff were good moved us to the Mayfair suit that was in the same state as the last room 
London Elizabeth Hotel, small room with very old furniture poor bathroom facility and old only one and very small elevator for 2 persons or one person with one medium luggage scary stairs 
London Elizabeth Hotel, There was no effective way to cool the room Just a useless noisy overhead fan that merely pushed warm air around the room The entire hotel is very tired and it feels unclean due to everything being so old and worn out
London Elizabeth Hotel, Bed not great and shower difficult to use The shower head was in a fixed position and you had to be a contortionist to get wet Sloping floor a bit disconcerting 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Traffic noise in bedroom 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Don t take room G19 really noisy outside There are lots of buses bikes going near the window all the night plus drunk people speaking loudly No chance to sleep Breakfast included porridge cheese eggs cruasans musli cucumbers and tomatoes that s all 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The atmosphere of the hotel has changed and lost its charm
London Elizabeth Hotel, very tired hotel well loved and clean the staff made our visit and they are the engine that powers this ship 
London Elizabeth Hotel, no working air conditioner maids had trouble having just a top sheet on bed without the big duvets needs more variety at breakfast shower screen comes only halfway down tub
London Elizabeth Hotel, The hotel is in a very bad shape Very old rusted cracks etc this is noticeable from the entrance reception and up to the room 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Very jaded accommodation needs updating carpets needed cleaning hot water was variable in the shower bathrooms need updating too cracked tiles and dated accessories
London Elizabeth Hotel, I ve never been so desperate to write a hotel review until after the stay at this hotel The room we were given is on basement level facing the busy street It s so noisy and we can t even sleep after midnight The bathroom seems a million years old and there are cracks on the tile There s basically no ventilation as if you open the window it will be even more noisy and will probably be the same as living on the street There s roof fan but you will not want to use it unless you want to increase the noisy level Choosing this hotel is definitely the worst choice that I ve made since Day 1 when I started using Booking com There s basically nothing to eat at breakfast Should ve stayed in a chain hotel as it won t go very wrong Absolutely hated it 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The lift could have been bigger The hairdryer is very outdated and it is most unusual to have it in the bathroom which also needs modernising 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Some staff not so polite but most nice Very tiny lift but expected in small old style hotel 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The food was pretty poor we did not even eat hardly any of it The food did not look appealing The bathroom tiles were cracked and dirty 
London Elizabeth Hotel, For the amount I paid I expected a room much bigger than the one I got It could have been a bit neater too cracks on the wall etc The bathroom was also extremely small Advertising needs to be clearer next time so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Room far too small and breakfast very poor Bananas were soft and poor quality of food Lift could only fit one person at a time Too expensive for what u get
London Elizabeth Hotel, Tiny lift which in fairness will be difficult to address This did not take anything away from our stay 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Very tired decor Tiny lift so if you were at the top of the hotel as I was the lift was always full when it arrived After waiting 20 minutes for an empty lift to no avail I hauled a heavy suitcase down 4 flights of stairs in order to check out This wasn t ideal 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Whilst there are a few signs of wear and tear in the fabric of the building they did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel 
London Elizabeth Hotel, A bit shabby all the doors chipped And the lift is tiny and very slow indeed 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Breakfast included should be full English and not a optional extra
London Elizabeth Hotel, We booked on special offer and were disappointed not to be told beforehand that our room was in need of refurbishment and walls on that floor patched ready for redecoration 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Nothing
London Elizabeth Hotel, Top floor room and lift slow and small Room compact and little dated Shower lacking any oomph General decor could be improved in room and common areas Crisps in room mini bar were from a multi pack and priced at 2 50
London Elizabeth Hotel, I got an email to up grade a few days before I arrived so I did thinking we would be getting a great deal Sadly the luxury upgrade promised did not happen Shabby tired decore with torn fabric chairs Continental breakfast a joke Won t stay again and will be dubious of emails promising luxury upgrades from booking com 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Unfortunately the fact that it s a beautiful listed building means its elevator is tiny so two trips for two people with suitcases are inevitable with a bit of a wait between them We didn t like the breakfast we weren t asked by the waitress what we d like to order so we just helped ourselves to the basic breakfast not a very varied selection You get charged 10 GBP on arrival just in case you use the mini bar I was surprised I was told on check out I d get the money back in a few weeks 
London Elizabeth Hotel, This is not a 4 star hotel The breakfeast was the poorest one I ever saw From the begining we missed a towel the showercape box was empty The shower was claustrofobical litle No shelf for the showergel bottles 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Bath bath taps were in need of replacement No mirror apart from in the bathroom The lift only held two people Their luggage needed a separate trip Continental breakfast was uninspiring 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The ensuite was the size of a broom cupboard and freezing Only a shower which was dated Our room backed onto the lift so sleep was not peaceful We had to move the beds apart to get a twin for my mother and myself and then could barely get out the door The room was tired and dated Paint off the walls and cracks
London Elizabeth Hotel, Broken tiles on the bathroom floor the hotel had placed rubber bath mats over them and the lack of hot water on the last morning although the receptionist did say the boiler had broken down Having said that we could only shower using ONLY the hot water tap 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The breakfasts were not as good as our previous stays at the hotel On our second morning there was no Weetabix available The manner and demeanour of the waitress was not very pleasant 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Sadly the shower put forth a tepid dribble literally insufficient for a functioning shower Discovered too late in the morning to do anything about it And the smell of the still tacky paint was less than perfect 
London Elizabeth Hotel,No Negative
London Elizabeth Hotel, We payed for a Suite accomodation which was very expensive we expected a cosy spacious place to stay with our baby What we ve got was an old and totally worn out place to stay furniture and seats were dirty mold smell chilly and cold everytime when we came into the room there was only heating with a small electrical heater central heating did not work in the bathroom so no heating last day even no hot water for shower or bath room service was horrible eg asking lukewarm wholemilk for the baby they forgot about it or it was too hot Some of staff were friendly mostly not Reception in 4 days we saw 4 different people only 1 was friendly Full continental breakfast was only 1 hard boiled egg and jam service horrible get your coffee yourself

London Elizabeth Hotel, Breakfast choices were poor No toaster no meats no cheese Just hard boiled eggs in shells dry bread and bizarrely tomato and cucumber slices Coffee was bitter No orange juice Some dry croissants then some strange pizza squares with little filling on them Fruit salad was mostly Apple We didn t complain as overall location wins Breakfast servers did seem half asleep though 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Very noisy location Curtains are not blackout the light shines to the room all night from the facade of the hotel Very poor shower The heating was not adequate for the size of the room 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The website said that the room would have a bathtub When we arrived to the hotel we discovered that it was not so 
London Elizabeth Hotel, Lift is tiny Buggy didn t fit inside and not more than two people fit in lift so when having luggage need to go up and down multiple times Room was far too small especially with cot No space to move or even to walk around Horrible Worst choice for breakfast I have ever had Extremely minimal Ended up having bread and butter for breakfast everyday due to a very poor selection 
London Elizabeth Hotel, none
London Elizabeth Hotel, Bedbugs in standard room I was bitten all over Blood on sheet And huge hollows in mattress perfect place for those bugs to live in As many people say in such situations the personnel refer to your allergy I personally have none and refuse any possibility of bugs co existence in hotel Hotel personnel immediately provided another room though not upgrade and continued to say that room is clean I did not have possibility to get my money back and had to stay there in a new room at basement floor It was clean and big but everything in this hotel is tired already 
London Elizabeth Hotel, The breakfast was extremely poor small selection of mini pastries and toast Not worth spending the extra money

London Elizabeth Hotel, Your site rated it 4 star and I doubt that unless the star rating system is different in UK A historic monument style hotel which is okay the really small room bearable but the bath toilet is just a box with no elbow room the tub meant for kids not an adult broken tiles on the floor soap scum on the curtains The free breakfast is just oats boiled eggs and bread everyday unless you pay and order more off their menu

IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio,No Negative
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, It is situated in a industrial area and quite a distance away from the train station There is however a direct bus to town which wasn t an option for us because the kiosks were all closed during the public holiday and we couldn t buy the tickets The hotel I must say is also a little worn down

IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, The room was very tired The furniture must be 15 years old and the bath had signs of rust and the door frame was rotting away 
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, Overall bad experience but the worst was the malfunctioning door key On average I had to come back to reception 3 times per day to activate the key card until finally a receptionist would open my room door for me On top of that there were no apologies all I got was a shoulder shrug 
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, The price is inconsistent from one week to the next making it very difficult to book consecutive weeks Breakfast is very hectic sometimes to the point that I didn t even bother 
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, Hotel is in a worn down condition Hotel stuff is acceptable with Italian standards breakfast is plenty but lacking any fresh vegetables The rooms are clean but simple some promised features coffee maker safe are missing The location is practically at the city limits the Milano city sign is right in front of the hotel so getting in town takes about 45 minutes 
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio,No Negative
IH Hotels Milano Lorenteggio, I travel a lot and have so far visited a countless number of hotels But this one is a true rarity Considering that such a brand is in a such condition I trust one should pay great efforts to find it Unbelievable In order to survive and remain safe and sound in this hotel you would need a spacesuit For starters to protect you from an invading army of germs and bacteria located all over the room carpets curtains drapes walls furniture etc not cleaned for years Though if you would like to see some animal species in action then the surprises are located above and under your bed But in order for all of this to be displayed first you need to enter your room In order for that to be possible you would have to ride in the elevator for dozen of times back and forth so that you convince the receptionist that the e key card she gave you for entering the room is dysfunctional preventing you from accessing the room even after her several unsuccessful undertakings to reprogram it After all of that they eventually decide it is time you get an assistance from the bellhop Though I would recommend you d better keep your distance from him should you like to breathe normally in the elevator We entered the room finally And what a surprise I changed three rooms in the attempt to decide in which one of them I wouldn t be more harmed and have higher chances of survival In the end I offered all my arguments means and persuasiveness to be accommodated at last and in decent conditions after such a lengthy agony And just guess the financial means won by putting an end to my torment I was asked to pay more in order to get a new special superior room with a pool view of which I m sending you couple of photos Luckily there was no carpet in it My dear travellers I wish you fully enjoy all 4 stars of this hotel Should I m asked to rate it my question is do you have rates starting from 0 and below Thank you

NH Carlton Amsterdam, The first room I went too had a smell of smoke none of the lights worked in the room and the fuse box was open I informed reception as I went out to dinner I only had 20 mins to checkin and get out again When I returned late that evening expecting a new room to be made available The night clerk assured me everything would be ok However it looked like no one had been up to the room to investigate or anything it was exactly the same as when I left They gave me a new room key three times I had to make the trip from reception to my room and none of the keys they gave me worked Only when the night clerk opened the door could I get in the room They room they moved me to was nowhere near as good as my original room

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Dear Sir hotel customer care I am currently staying in the NH Carlton Amsterdam The experience has been more than terrible When I arrived my booking via booking com did not showed the person in the reception was making me and asking me if I was sure what was my name asked me to return 30 minutes latter They were able to find my reservation and I was given a room after 1 hour and 4 PM Then I went out to eat and when I came back my key did not work the lady in the reception told me the key will not work if it is near a phone or a wallet after 15 minutes waiting no other place happens this I got to the room and the TV did not work I called the reception and they told me to wait for 20 minutes I had to go down and talk with the manager in charge so he could check the TV Some else joined me and she found the TV did not work and offered to check it by a technician the day after She was trying not to even offer to change the room I insisted and finally agreed I had to pack and get down get a new key and change no follow up call if things were working they could not care less I do not know who is in charge but I guess they do not really care about the customer the experience or the property I understand things might go wrong but the staff is not enough not willing to solve problems or the customer I will take this to social media and review it on booking com 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms were not offering value for money Our toilet was smelly and taking a shower was a mission
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Cleanliness in the room was no up to standards bedside table and lamp seemed not be dusted during my whole stay Breakfast was boring exact same items everyday 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I would recommend to do some replenishment on carpet so far and interior in the room as it look quite old 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms a bit tired need a refurb and not cleaned as well as I would like a bit dust on shelves and carpet needed a better hoover
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Didn t like when we arrived they asked for more money at the hotel when everything was already paid for took 50 off us incase we used mini bar ate a snickers bar and a packet of crisps and only received 20 back from the deposit of 50 annoyed how those two things were 30
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room wasnt clean we asked again and again but nothing happend The staff didnt do anything untill manger was involved Very bad I trust booking for its quality hotels and reviews i will not order soon 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Pathetic room absolutely pathetic super duper duper small didnot look like anything in the pictures They dont even have a person to carry the bags
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was tiny the beds very hard It wasn t possible for two people to use the bathroom The air conditioning was very noisy sounded more like a washing machine and the Windows had been sealed so we couldn t open them instead We asked to borrow a charger but they said that we must give our devices to them to charge which we weren t very happy about 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Older building could use some remodeling poor air conditioning system outdated bathroom 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I was over charged on my bill for items I never had Room was nothing like the pictures very cramped extremely noisy even though I was on the 7th floor Web site led me to believe that the hotel won an award in 2016 yet the hotel I stayed at was yet to be refurbishes Will not stay at any NH Carlton chain again 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are quite small and some overlook the wall in front Also hotel is old one so be ready for old style room setup 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bathroom had seen better days and the area round the sink was in need of some repair These facts did not really affect our enjoyment though as the shower worked well and was lovely and hot 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, A couple of minor defects reported to reception were not dealt with broken shower head and magnifying mirror Although we were offered a change of room this was not convenient and we would rather have had the problems resolved Lighting in bathroom could be better 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, However the cleanliness was very bad The plasma was very dusty The bath was not cleaned properly and the lamps were all dusty
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is Just old the staff was rude the housekeeping got angry because we stayed in the room and she told me I will not clean your room today One bottle of still water 1L costs 8 5 Euro I booked Standard Double or Twin Room and it was different from the pictures 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although it was a great hotel to stay at the Wi Fi was terrible and would not work half the time even when I paid 20 euros for the extra fast The Wi Fi is not even managed by the hotel so they couldn t do anything about it except removes the fees for the extra Wi Fi I paid If you are a professional looking to work and have access to a stable connection most of the time you couldnt even connect to facebook this hotel might not be the best choice Also some of the power outlets where impossible to use with adapters and none of them where close to the bed None of them where in the bathroom making if impossible to use any curling or straightening irons 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Really cheap rooms We got a room with a window that we can t close The wind opens it all the time and the rain comes in In addition the water rope in the bath was damaged so we went to the front desk and after 20 minutes they gave us another room in a different floor Me and my girlfriend in the middle of the night moved to another floor and then surprise the room is so stinking again to the desk and we got another room in a different floor no help by the team of the hotel to move the things in this 3rd room we got 2 separated beds even we booked 1 big bed and the air condition didn t work We stayed in this room because we realized that this is a broken hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unfortunately when checking in we had to pay a 50 deposit and took an extra 50 for city tax and deposit for if you use the mini bar or breakfast This was not mentioned on booking So be aware before coming as it may leave you short If paying by debit or credit card be aware they will give you the deposit back but in cash So you may receive hidden charges 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, There was an issue with my reservation and the staff wasn t very helpful with it Long check in time curtains in the bath plus the drain wasn t working well and they didn t fix it before my departure 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unproffesional prepared staff they missinformed us on how much we have to pay in total so i would recomand to write on recipt what you actually pay for not only that you payed x amount of money but also what for in detail bathroom was not completly clean and trash was not taken out
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The beds were hard and the hotel did nothing to change them despite request the room service was poor not properly cleaned and consumables not replaced no improvement despite complaint Our plumbing had a problem and we were offered an upgrade but the offered room was smaller We requested a late check out and despite having been at the hotel for a full week were told it was against policy and we d have to pay an hourly rate We asked to see a Manager on Sunday but were told that no manager was on duty in the hotel It s a shame a hotel with potential let down by staff who do not see the need to provide good customer satisfaction I will not return to the hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is dirty and run down Drains did not work well in shower so hard to take a full shower Bathroom sink drain also slow Although the site indicates air conditioning there was no air conditioning to speak of in our room very very hot Needs an update and I say this because we were paying 300 euros a night for the room on the weekend this was certainly not good value 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was old and shabby looking the carpet was stained and worn looking Some stray hairs in bathroom on arrival so not cleaned properly over priced as could have booked five star at dam square for 300 less than we paid through same company like our friends who travelled with us
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was dirty and over priced Not as described in pics Tub was Dirty hair from others on bed an bath Lack of pillows asked for addition pillows they could not proved any 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, No ice bucket The room service is not 24 hours The kitchen timings is different from the bar timings They do not offer complimentary water The rooms AC was not working 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was straight from 80 s totally out of date Also small bathroom was worn out Sound insulation poor Fortynately we had reserved only one night No reason to never come back We are willing to pay for this price level if we get value for the money this was totally overpriced We suggest a full renovation of the whole hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, bed with sprinters in your back tiny bathroom low light semi plugged sink can t close the curtains all the way so there s always light in the morning the crew didn t fully understand us and we didn t understand them 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, My credit card was pre charged and there was some confusion about the tariff applied which is still being worked on Staff friendly but hard to get in contact with them phone system sends you around between different people and I d prefer an email contact being remote 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our room was on the first floor which was a bit noisy as the door opened on to a mezzanine above the reception 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very compact room with limited space to move You have to climb up a chair to go to other part of the room Such a room with 250 chf is not worth in Value for Money 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, A lot of thing the staff was not helpful at all when we wanted to stay more in the hotel they looked like they want us to leave and one of the mangers kept increasing the price on us and the most descanting thing was the cleaning they say that they finish their shift at 3 so for the hall stay we did get our room cleaned only on the first 2 days that was so bad so bad so bad
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Checkin took too long Though checkin time is 3 pm we only got the room at 4 pm Front desk is understaffed and there is no concierge so the front desk have to keep running to help guests store luggage take it out etc 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms facing the front street are too noisy due to the Amsterdam nightlife The trams can also make some noise If you enjoy your sleep and are disturbed easily request a room in the back The internet service is far from being optimal One would say that the hotel provides it for free but on the other hand we do pay for the rooms more than in other hotels 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bathroom was a bit small but not enough to negatively impact this property 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was in serious need of new carpet a new chair and curtains All were disgustingly stained dirty The door jams entries from the room to the terrace and the room to the bathroom didn t look like they had been cleaned in quite a while We were not comfortable walking around the room without shoes socks only were debatable but certainly not our bare feet We did not use the chair at all and covered it with a towel The bathroom overall was so so the towel drying rack was a bit rusty and creepy but that was mostly a visual issue We are not really very particular about these things normally but have never experienced a room such as this and it really was unexceptable for the price We have paid much less for much better at hotels in the past in premium locations so it was a bit disappointing 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Heating in the room did not work Staff were too few and kept us waiting Missing a concierge to take care of missing bulbs in lamp Lights in bathroom is insufficient Staff at reception appeared untrained and effective
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The price I paid for the room was grossly expensive The mattresses are uncomfortable The queues to check in out were ridiculous with just two staff on the desk when their is clearly room for four staff It took me 48 minutes to check in That is not good enough 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The a c does not work properly sometimes it s cold other times it s hot they don t clean the rooms the cleaner comes every other day and tidy the bed only no vacuum cleaning or changing the bed sheets nor cleaning the toilet 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bath room is smelling bad smell The hoousekeeping is not good The reception staff are not friendly The hospitality of the hotel in general is not good for a 4 star hotel Not worth the money 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel really requires renovation Carpets have lost the color already closet door did not work Restaurant the same Had a cleaning lady in my room when returned from breakfast still wanted to do stuff like brushing teeth but had to wait until she s done 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The only off putting factor was the carpet in the room It was old and faded green orange and yellow yuck and the window of the room backed onto offices which isn t a nice sight for anyone Very over priced for what it is but I did book quite late The aircon didn t work so we are lucky it wasn t mid summer during our trip 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, it was 4 star hotel and they didn t have bell boy so we had to carry our stuff our friends checked in the same day before 3 p m but they didn t let us check in until 3 p m as we arrived at 11 a m the cleaning wasn t very good and it s over prized for the services and doesn t include breakfast i won t recommend it to any one
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is a bit oudated the cleanliness of the room could be more upgraded the first 2 nights the room maid was not doing her job well the glasses and cups was not washed but the days after until checked out the room maid was doing very well 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, No aircon rooms were boiling We asked 3 times for them to turn main aircon on Said couldn t as they don t switch it on in winter Curtains were dirty and torn terribly If u opened your windows it was so noisy you couldn t sleep because of noise
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very long lines at reception always Noisy rooms even on the 7th floor AC doesn t work in both of our rooms Heater won t turn off took staff one hour to figure that out still didnt fix it I had to sleep into a steamroom tempreture Staff is not helpful at all 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, When checking out receptionist tried to charge us an extra 90 euros on top of 615 euros already paid through booking com for 3 nights room only Told it was tax but spoke to manager eventually and owed 29 euro tax I was under the impression that the tax had already been added on by booking com Not happy 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room 529 that I stayed The sink was broken the hose of the shower was broken and water was leaking the room was very cold and eventually one of the employees brought an electrical radiator to warm it up 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, All the rest This hotel is far from luxury standards I definitely recommend not to stay in this hotel Staff is nice but not really competent Cleaning equipments rate price vs quality is very low Don t be silly and for the same price get something much better 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our room was tiny Twin beds pushed together and no room on one side to get in to the bed Carpet was completely worn This place needs a complete refurb Paid 654 euros which was extortion for the room state 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room wasn t very clean stains on wall and side of bed Wanted to pay in cash but hotel had already charged my credit card 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, NH Carlton is part of the NH group Upon our arrival they said that the hotel had been overbooked and that we had to move to another hotel which was further away from the centre of the city so we declined We ended up having to spend one night in the NH Barbizon Palace and then transfer back to our original hotel for the last three nights This was an inconvience and wasted time on our first night in Amsterdam This happens a lot from what we witnessed just walking through reception This really put us off returning to Amsterdam because even though we had a confirmed booking email in the NH Carlton they gave our room to someone else Very unreliable 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, 1 unprofessional and rude stuff at the reception 2 very old hotel with a very old furniture never renewed 3 smiley toilets and uncleared 4 the room price is very high in comparison with the hotel services quality facilities In my opinion as regular traveler I think this hotel deserves 2 starts not even 3 and I don t recommend it to anyone very bad experience 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, First of all during check in my credit card was overcharged for one extra room After my direct objection on he same day though I was told by the receptionist that the receptionist corrected it by herself I learnt during the checkout that it was a lie She did not make the necessary corrections at all This was confirmed by a much more experienced kind gentleman working in the reception Secondly the room I was staying was not clean at all There were red fingerprints in the restroom door There was even no dress hanger at my room In the second day though it was clear that my shirts were drying in the chair there was no correction by putting something They even did not put clean plastics glasses for the second day After paying a fortune for two days these examples convinced me that I will never ever stay in this hotel again 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The whole sorry experience
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Better tea coffee facilities in room No milk provided 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, We arrived a bit early and had our bags in locker till room was ready at 300 sharp it was ready but would have appreciated it more if it could have been ready a little bit earlier since we were tired of travelling but they took our luggage to the locker and we were free to roam about till room was ready 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was dusty Once I lay down to rest my whole body felt itchy I got few bug bites from it The bathroom smelled like sewage for the first day Towels smelled like vinegar and it was very tough Staffs are trying to be polite and patient but you can tell that they are getting irritated while we were checking in The most disturbing thing among all is that on the 1st day one of the staff came into the room after knocking the door for few seconds without permission Which was a big surprise but he did not even apologize for this action He just asked whether the fridge was fine or not and left the room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, In general the reception and some of the open spaces could do with brightening up The reception in general looked very dated 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel could do a refurbish new carpets paint 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The wifi could have been better plus our room didn t get cleaned for 2 days which was annoying but not the end of the world We did have a problem with the heater in our room but they did fix it 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Lighting in the room no very bright for putting on make up or reading
NH Carlton Amsterdam, There was nothing about our stay we didn t enjoy 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bath was a little bit small
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was appalling filthy linen curtains and just overall dirty Carpets were threadbare The view from the room just re iterated what the room was like 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Absolutely filthy could smell urine in the bathroom only to find on the morning we left someone had passed urine up the bathroom door and it had been left Bare wires on lamp dirty stains everywhere Was promised a nice room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I requested for the room to be modified before going as it was a special occasion yet they didn t do anything for this I have previously stayed in an NH hotel before for an occasion and they upgraded my room and brought gifts When I got there I tried explaining but the language barrier meant nothing was done to the room They didn t give me a menu to add balloons or other gifts at an additional price like they had done before which was a little disappointing as a little extra detail in the room would have made the holiday 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Coming in to the hotel desk at 22 30 after a 700km day drive and find out that our rooms were not reserved for us due to the fact that booking com website was publishing free rooms and confirming my reservation in the hotel after the hotel was already fully booked that s what the reception representative at the hotel told us We had to take the offer that they made to us and walk with our luggage to a nearby hotel run by the same net and stay there 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, You should book if you want to stay in the heart of Amsterdam in decent but not extraordinary conditions and you don t care that much about the money you pay The room we stayed was relatively small but clean enough to not get angry One thing that bothered us was that the person checking the bar was knocking and entering without waiting for an answer while I was taking a shower Also if you use room service the price for delivering the order is very high Overall bad value for money paid 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Dirty as you can think of Bed had hair from past guests Toilet was filthy and very dark for a reason I guess Should not have costed more than 50 and not a 4 by any means Downgrade it to be known as a reliable hotel booking website
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The dirt broken electrical sockets blood on sheets multiple things and to top it off a mouse baby rat in our room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although my room was clean tidy and comfortable the lighting was vey poor It was difficult to read anything and no light for the main area of the room
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room 333 was very basic and the carpet was disgraceful years old with lots of stains didn t want to take socks off The bathroom ceiling had marks on from damp No heating in room so it was cold The receptionist informed us that we have been given a good room overlooking the flower market All you could see was the plastic roofing with rubbish on the top I informed the hotel it was my partners 60th and for over 150 per night I expected better 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, i sat in the ground floor restaurant for 5 minutes and nobody acknowledged my prescence so I went elsewhere to eat
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Carpets and bedroom furniture is a little dated and tired looking in the room

NH Carlton Amsterdam, This is the second time a guest hotel staff upgraded the rooms and I thank you for that We had a problem in one room the room heater did not work Alerted the hotel staff tried unsuccessfully to treat for two days but there quarters of people in 1 room Only one room was given a discount of 10 percent despite we four adults we had to stay in Room 1
NH Carlton Amsterdam, shower didn t work rooms and corridors old and ugly overall it looks like it was built in the 1970 s and never ever updated Very ugly and not at all acceptable for a 4 stars hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Late check in time but early check out time it would be great if the hotel could make the check in slightly earlier 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel did not reflect what we paid for it In your room you could hear noice from the hallways constantly Also the noice outside on the street could be heard all through the night extremely loudly even though we were on the 5th floor Room decor was extremely poor
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I think the rooms were a little smaller than i imagined from the photos 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Confused check in payment and booking were not found by hotel and it took a while until they find info and let us get the room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Standard Double or Twin Room is like a low budget hotel room small and smelly room clogged bath tub outdated furniture dirty carpet The photos provided on the website don t correspond to the actual state of the room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was uncleaned upon entry evidenced by finding random small items around the room including an ear ring and a lot of crumbs about the place electricity kept tripping off in our room to the point where a member of staff showed us how to put it back on in our room broken shower hose that could have been avoided given regular checking broken heating air conditioning unit broken electrical heater sent to deal with lack of heating air con unit that was broken city wide blackout took place not the hotels fault of course but there was no emergency lighting in hallways leading out of the building had to use mobile lights to get downstairs cleaners took off please clean my room sign but did not replace our towels or toilet paper roll key cards failed even though we did not place them anywhere near our mobile phones 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, First of all the pictures don t look like the real thing the pictures make it look luxurious when it s not On arrival I was informed that breakfast is infact NOT included I have travelled the world and never once stayed in a hotel where breakfast wasn t included I was told I needed to pay an extra 18 EACH per day for breakfast That s an extra 72 on top of what I already paid We decided against that and just ate out Our room stank of oldness and foostyness The decor is soo dated like 1960 s The room was tiny basic and it was dirty There was a panel on the ceiling hanging off The bathroom was filthy there was dirt in the bath The radiator had flaky paint and rust all over it I went into the wardrobe to get the iron and there wasn t one Something I have never experienced in a hotel room I called reception and I was told there s a room on the 7th floor with an iron Looooong but I went up there it was a dingy little freezing cold room with an ironing board and iron Started ironing and there was dirt all over the iron which went onto my white shirt luckily I had turned it inside out and it kept turning off Overall I was extremely disappointed for the money I paid for this hotel I was expecting a lot more It was my boyfriends birthday and wanted it be to special This was advertised as Luxury deal There was nothing luxury about it at all It should have cost a lot more than what I paid as well Thank God I hadn t paid full price I ll know next time I go to Amsterdam never to go back to this hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The heat was not working in my room They brought in a space heater which did not have the capacity of heating the room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, It can be quite noisy at night especially on the weekends even though we were on the fifth floor 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, When I arrived at the nh carlton we checked in and was given our room As soon as we got inside the room we could see the place had not been cleaned correctly and there was hairs on pilliow case and inside my bed I did make a complaint to reception as I could not sleep in that room as I felt very dirty after seeing hairs and items uncleaned I also took photos of the room as I couldn t believe this is standard we got at the nh carlton I felt my money was robbed as all we had was our room changed and that wasn t even clean either but by then we had spend long enough trying to sort out our room We accepted the hotel didn t care and tried to make the most of our holiday but never would I recommend any one to stay there 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The guarantee taken on my credit card who still does that only old hotel chains The hotel is running on its location and name They do the minimum for the rest I ask for a double bed they put two very small single bed next to the other
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Mainly the only thing we didn t like was the bathroom it just needs a bit of updating as there was quite a bit of rust Also toilet lid was badly discoloured I cut the underneath of my toe whilst in shower as the plug waste was badly eroded and had a sharp piece of metal sticking up Though my toe bled it wasn t for long so didn t cause a fuss I managed to bend and take the sharp piece and threw it away save the next person having a sore toe But in saying all this seriously the shower was in good working order The bathroom served it s purpose and you go to Amsterdam to get out and see the sites not to spend most of your time admiring the room bathroom lol 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although several front desk personnel were quite helpful there were a couple in particular who were not pleasant We had small children who were irritated and not perfectly behaved at all times and Americans who didn t speak any Dutch so maybe that did play apart 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, That they don t have staff 2 carry out bags and sometimes they just entre the room without even asking even if I kept Do not distrib I see they come in the room 2 clean it
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Nothing
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Booking processing and check in room cleaning Property definitely needs renovation and management work with linear staff To be short I didn t get at all a desire to come back and stay again 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Smell of cannabis in room and had to wait 1hour 30mins for the room to be ready after check in time 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, On the other hand the hotel was a bit old and smelled like mold It is definitely a 2 star hotel the bedroom was tiny and the bed sheets smelled weird The bedroom was cold as well 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Corridor and room smelt of smoke Hotel needs updating Bathroom vile Deep deep clean required 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms were very outdated and found our room cold although we had the heating on all the time Expensive for what it was 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Booked to pay when i got there and requested a room i had stayed in before which i was told was available for an extra 20 euros a night which i agreed when i arrived i was told i now was not getting that room as it had been double booked and was charged 100 pound more than the original frozen price i had booked 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, it was clean and comfortable but very basic The room didn t reflect the price we paid but cities can be like that
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are very basic Mattress was stained bathroom was a bit smelly

NH Carlton Amsterdam, The wi fi was sometimes slow Once when i asked reception to call a taxi the one that came was not an official taxi and did not have a meter 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The only issue I had with the heating in the room Didn t seem to work properly So the room was a bit cold 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Had issues with the cards for the hotel room every day which was quite a big problem
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms looked a bit dated Free WiFi service was a shambles slow and connection was never stable Would be good to have cabled connections in the room for business travelers 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are shabby 3 at best Our room had a cracked sink cracked floor tiles in the bathroom and heating that didn t work The bed was so wobbly I though it was going to collapse and the mattress was rock hard and very uncomfortable Staff don t know where nearby attractions are or how to get to them 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, A suprise add on to my final bill on check out of the City Tax after I had paid in advance for the special offer This was not made obvious at the time of boooking the trip monthe before 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I have stayed in this hotel 9 years ago and was happy with it so I was skeptical towards the reviews of other travelers boy was I wrong The hotel is in such a bad condition hard to believe this is possible in the middle of Amsterdam carpets were soooo old and fitlhy dirty and by this I do not mean a spot here and there Our bathroom stank of urine yellow spots behind the toilet the bathtub was just discusting The hotel corridors were smelly as well The only thing why we havent left immediately were the clean though old and washed towels and bedsheets This is not a four star hotel two stars maximum and absolutely not worth the money 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bad pillows The rooms was freezing no blankets more i was very cold Warm air doesn t work
NH Carlton Amsterdam, My room had 2 doors to the balcony it was little bit cold I tried to use AC but it took too long time to heat the room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Badly stained and Worn carpets looked like the room needed polishing and cleaning Felt like we had been thrown in an old room wouldn t stay here again 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was small The carpets were heavily stained and discoloured The head board was like a shelf at a height that you banged your head when in bed The pillows were rubbish Would not give us any milk for our tea The quilt was too small for the bed The bathroom smelled of stale mould from the shower curtain I have been in better 3 hotels which were better for less money Out dated and in need of refurbishment 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I had to pay for an upgrade and never even got the balcony Room 116 The sink must have a blockage as it wasn t clearing as it should it took a lot longer than it should The room was very noisy for the Main Street I expected that in the main square but not where we were With our room being on the first floor at the end of the corridor we heard every single other customer come and go For this being my brithday I was willing to spend more money for the occasion but felt let down having stayed in cheaper places to a better quality I d go back to Amsterdam but not this Hotel 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel was not properly cleaned and maintained Housekeeping was poor although the staff was very nice and friendly The trash on the floor of the hallway has been there for perhaps over two days since we arrived Walls and carpets are obviously old and dirty One light of our room kept flickering The toiletries in the bathroom were not complete For example there was a shampoo bottle but no shower gel bottle Perhaps they were understaffed during our stay because housekeeping only got to clean our room at 4pm I know because we got back to the hotel by 4pm Bed linens were not ironed Wifi was very slow 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms were absolutely filthy We had requested double beds and ended up with 2 single camp beds in each room There was some sort of party going on until late into the night and it was an appalling experience all round 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bedroom carpet in our room really needed replacing due to staining but I believe the management have a programme of reburshment well underway Small bar in the foyer didn t seem to be manned even though it stated it was open from 1030 to 10pm didn t actually see anybody use it during our 3 day stay which was a shame as it would have been nice to use it at the end of a days sightseeing rather than rely totally on outside bars 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Arrived on cold day window open bitter cold complained maintenance checked couldnt fix promised heater which was supplied after a mini scandal on second day Slept first night with socks and sweater 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Nothing
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bathroom was cramped and smelt mildewed Rooms are in dire need of renovation Paint peeling upholstery is stained Enhanced internet slow 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel charged me an extra 60 00 and have still not replied to any of my emails and I am still waiting for response Absolutely disgusting that they can just take money out of my account and not respond regarding this 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Called housekeeping reg the heating as my room were freezing they said all the heaters was with other guests but they would look into it and get back to me Never heard anything and the room stayed freezing Also called roomservice to order a meal They said it would take 20 min After 15 they called me back and said they had run out of that dish I ordered something else and the bred was old and soggy and it tasted like a microwave heated frozen dinner 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very overpriced Needs a good decorate Carpets are dirty Curtain pole hanging off wall Very poor shower Drips out 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel needs modernising to be 4star its a 3 at a push Front desk staff could be friendlier Also would be nice if you could get an iron sent to your room rather then using one that hardly worked in a room on the 7th floor
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bed was 1m80 But so were the sheets so the sheets were NOT big enough for two people There were a lot of hairs and remains of soap in the drain of the shower and the lavabo 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an extra 20 euro a night which we jumped at So was very shocked when we saw our superior room was tiny and had not been decorated in a long time The price we paid was rediculous for the room we were given Dread to think the size of a standard room I phoned reception to check we had been given an upgrade I was told yes and their standard rooms are even smaller The bathroom was tiny and the shower was terrible We spent almost 500 for 2 nights and the room was a massive let down We paid half that for 2 nights in Rotterdam at NHow and the room was out of this world 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room itself was outdated and could do with a refurbishment 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are shabby and the hotel feels very old Because of its great location it is very noisy during the night Rooms are extremely small

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unfortunately for us there were road works directly outside our window for the whole night we stayed so we didn t sleep When said to man on reception at 4a m he gave me ear plugs They didn t block out the drills or whatever were making the noise outside 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms dated and balcony door repeatedly opened during night due to breeze We were unable to lock it on our 1st night and felt unsafe The next day at 12noon we reported the problem to reception When we returned that evening at 8 no action had been taken to resolve problem When we complained the 2nd time we moved rooms
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are a little small but a huge bed and huge tv 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Air quality was poor in our area of the hotel stuffy we were in a room with windows that did not open so no air circulation However trade off was a nice large room

NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very dark and dated hotel Bedroom was small and in bad need of decorating Carpet on floor was disgusting would not walk barefoot on it We both got some kind of bug bites in room Way overpriced I was very disappointed as this was a suprise trip for my husbands birthday and this was supposed to be a treat we have stayed in much cheaper better accommodation in Amsterdam before
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The first night we were in a room on the 3rd floor It was shocking I couldn t get to the toilet because it was behind the door and there was no room as I had to go on crutches I had rung up from Ireland before we went and was told that we would be given a large room The specially adapted room was occupied on the first night At least we had it the second night 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hour wait to check in Being given someone else s room then having to sort that out The cracked sink in our bathroom and a cigar smell when entering our room

NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is 3 max There was even cockroach in the bathroom No robes or sleepers Bathroom size is tiny Furniture from 80th we came two people but everything in the room was only for one Sink was broken Awful 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, As most hotels in central Amsterdam they are overpriced This hotel is no exception To pay an extra EUR29 per day for the breakfast buffet on top of the already high room rate is just ridiculous The buffet did not look that great to suggest such exorbitant rate would be justified I only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and instead just had breakfast for less than half the price in one of the cafes nearby Or simply grab some nice food and a coffee from one of the nearby bakeries The room was overlooking one of the streets with restaurants and bars so Thu Sun night usually means drunk people yelling off the top of their voices until 5am in the morning The room s windows weren t sealed that well to cancel out the noise In fact the first night I got up twice to check that all the windows were closed completely which they were but it was just that noisy 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Waiting around to check in as our room wasn t ready after 3pm check in and at the price we paid we shouldn t have to wait for our room So very annoying and not a complimentary drink to make it feel better
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Staff completely clueless Hotel is old and rooms are run down Problems with checking in and checking out Not able to provide simple invoice and simultaneously rude about it all In fact I have never had combination like this but this was probably one of the worst organised hotels I stayed in since a long time I DO NOT recommend considering choice of hotels in that area

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bedroom was filthy smelly and tiny for a twin room I had to complain and eventually was upgraded but asked to pay more Totally disappointed with staff attitude 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room size was a bit small but everything in the Netherlands is small so I wouldn t really say it was a negative just something you need to expect

NH Carlton Amsterdam, On the second floor to the front of the hotel was nota good idea you can hear al lot of the street noise including the yelling drunks at 4 AM Hundreds of bicycles parked some badly on the sidewalk in front of the hotel hard to walk around them 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was old fashioned bath was stained carpet was dirty cigarette ends swept in the corner of balcony no chairs to sit on the balcony Don t be fooled when you walk into the reception Not worth the money that it cost 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Was disappointed in the standard of the room which was dated Hospitality tray was never refreshed throughout our stay and cups were stained 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The internet is terrible 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was described to me as a suite upon check in so I accepted it sight unseen However it turned out that it was just a badly laid out over sized space with a filthy and threadbare carpet and scruffy furniture Plus despite repeated requests the teabags in my room were not replenished Certainly not worth the 160 euros per night I paid for it 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Carpet in room very dirty in places smell of urine in bathroom when we arrived We left some plastic containers on desk and they had gone when we returned 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room Mold in the bathroom paint peeling old musty hallways old paint peeling carpet torn just aweful Not worth the money 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The air conditioning goes on an energy saving setting at night which made it hard to sleep and uncomfortable room temperature 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel itself as well as the room were disappointing for the price The facilities room size and starchy towels do not reflect the rating Also what was considered a terrace is far from what you d expect Some of the rooms face onto busy bar streets which can cause disturbance during the night 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bedroom bathroom in a bit of disrepair wallpaper coming away ballroom grout black in places redecorating a must Cigarette ends left on terrace balcony chair covered in crumbs from previous occupancy Definately not worth the money

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our request for an extra child bed via Booking Com had not been noted We arrived after 11pm and they suggested that we should sleep three in a bed for the first night It took over an hour for them to agree to find a room where an extra sofa bed could be made up for us two very tired children and one grandparent 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, One of the staff members here was very rude because I asked him for water He told me to shut up in front of other guests and was so intimidating and rude The director is investigating and offered us a free ride to the airport for compensation but that kind of behaviour by reception staff was absolutely disgusting and have never experienced that anywhere before All other staff were amazing but this shouldn t have happened at all just because I asked for a jug of water 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel was dismal shabby and dirty Although staff were friendly the systems were poor eg check in procedure took almost an hour We requested 3 times that the flashing light on our phone be switched off nobody came Ended up putting a pillow on it Our room was advertised with a terrace Huh This was 2 feet wide and you would have had to climb out of the window to stand on it It was filthy with cigarette ends and used condoms 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Check in and out is log tedious process Room was dirty bought the advanced wifi with no wifi signal in room Rooms are extremely out dated and old Airconditioning barely works

NH Carlton Amsterdam, 4 Common areas very dated a bit institutional Looks a bit like a 70 s throw back Triangular mirror in the room with a flat screen TV stuck to one side Bar is also a bit of an excuse totally incomparable to others in the immediate vicinity but I presume it helps keep a star and prices up 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, We were required to give the staff without having a receipt 50 euros for having our bags kept after check out They mixed our receipt with another person 3 floors below us and we ended up with their private bank numbers Luckily the numbers were not complete and the person is safe with me

NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room itself wasn t up to the standard of a four star hotel Features on the wall were coming off crack tiles on the floor Also the door for the balcony had broke so you couldn t close it properly Value of money was extremely poor and given that i would defiantly look else where to stay next time in Amsterdam

NH Carlton Amsterdam, arrived quite early about 830am after traveling from the states Although the room was available the policy is to charge an extra 30euros to check in Needless to say this did not make me happy i travel often have never had this happen at various hotels throughout the world so we waited a few hours then was able to get into room at no charge I believe this is not good customer service if the room is available I understand if totally booked but this was not the case This was a waste of time when we could have been catching up on needed sleep Room rug not so clean shower curtain too long excess hanging in the tub and although total charge close to 800 for 4 nites it didn t include breakfast The best part of this hotel is it s location Also our room at nite had a lot of street noise 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, bathroom was OK no more
NH Carlton Amsterdam, problematic reception and cleening endless problems with electricity
NH Carlton Amsterdam, to be honest we were shown a different room with a nicer balcony but the one we had was fine
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Nothing
NH Carlton Amsterdam, We had our pleaseant stay in Amsterdam and did not dispute with hotel staff on any issues but in fact they cheated you in each step The room for 250 eur per night was extra small room number 642 During the check out on Sunday 10 am the terminal for pyments was not working They said their price for shutttel taxi to airport is fixed for 45 eur but their driver charged as per his taxi meter

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Some members of staff were rude luckily others made up for this 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The blanket was too warm Edges of the wallpaper in the room were torn 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was too small for two people We paid a lot of money for the room and I felt we could have had a bigger room The room needs updated It was a little shabby in places The housekeeper took hours to clean our room on the first day of our holiday 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms could really do with a refurbished but ARE clean 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, I had to request hangers when I arrived as they were missing The shaving mirror was missing There was a lot of rust on the towel heater The lock on my window was broken when the wind blew it would open letting cold air came in during the night The heater didn t work in the bedroom so I slept with two blankets Basically the rooms are very tired looking and need a refurbishment 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room has very poor soundproofing and the hotel is near a club where the noise can be heard till early ours of the next day Parking is also not well organized and can be improved
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Paid 50 euro deposit for mini bar and on departure was charged city tax but didn t use any of the mini bar so not sure why had to pay city tax first night was freezing no heat in room 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Yes rooms were old fashioned and could do with redecoration For me however it was how little space there was in the room But then again the hotel is catering for hundreds of people so it is to be expected 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The first room we were given had a problem in that the window would burst open whenever the wind blew but staff were quick to upgrade us to a far better suite which we were very grateful of The hotel is in a really central location but it does mean it can be noisy from the street at night Rooms are a little old fashioned and need spruced up but all in all it was a great place for a short weekend break 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, 1 Very noisy location could not sleep till 3 a m on the second night because of noise from outside on a sixth floor when specifically I requested a QUIET room Apparently there was double glazing in the window obviously of very poor quality 2 Overpriced for the room d cor etc 3 I was extremely tired and groggy on the last day morning because of lack of sleep I left some important paperwork and my reading glasses in the room I have emailed several times since then requesting them to return these and offering to pay the postage did not even get a single response

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very few front desk staff waited in line for 30 minutes to check out Staff available were also very slow at processing

NH Carlton Amsterdam, That my room was not cleaned until 15 45 the 2nd day There was no table beside the bed The only table was very heavy to move 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, only down side was the bed we have traveled quite a bit in hotels and b bs but never had a bed so uncomfortable i think they need to replace them we didnt get a good nights sleep while we were there and the carpet was well worn in room for a hotel of this rating i would expect a little bit more but other than that the staff were a delight and very helpful 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Limited amount of coffee sugar and milk but if you ask they did give you more room was freezing think the heating turned off half of the time very poor lighting carpet scruffy 
NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative
NH Carlton Amsterdam, A bit brighter lighting in the room would have been good 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, Waited for 20 minutes to check in and even longer to check out Organised chaos on reception desk The central heating did not work in our room and although the maintenance man came straight away to review the problem he arrived armed with a portable heater he said it is an ongoing problem with the whole building It took a while to heat the room thankfully we were only in there to sleep so did not bother us too much The room was big enough for a weekend stay the bathroom was very small had to close the door to use the toilet Towel rail was rusty Feel it s slightly overpriced could do with an update

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Teas and coffees weren t replenished in the room on the second or third day an oversight and there were no milks provided not a major problem as there was an M and S a stones throw away and we bought some milk and kept in the fridge but asked on the first occasion for more tea and coffee and it didnt materialise

NH Carlton Amsterdam, Housekeeping was not great My daughters room was not serviced at all one day and small things like a pillowcase was just left lying in the basin in my room the one day Attention to detail in cleaning could have been better Nothing serious though thought 50 Euro deposit per room for mini bar was also a bit steep especially when they had my credit card details as security anyway Breakfast very expensive We chose to eat elsewhere 
NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is worn down The halls give a small town Holiday Inn type of feeling like there just isn t enough business to maintain and renovate The bathroom is small and old so that you never really can get it clean anymore Security is lax Anyone who gets into the lobby can go up the elevator to whatever floor they want The price performance of this hotel is quite poor I paid 200 for a hotel that should never cost more than 100
