0,Hotel Cavendish, This property was not up to any standards Pillows were so old and should have been replaced long ago The tap on the bathroom sink barely ran water The room was supposed to be for three people and there was literally no room for luggage We had to open one case at a time as there was no room for us to manage all three pieces of luggage The chair opened up to a bed which was so uncomfortable that my grandson had the worst sleeps in the 21 days we were travelling When I went to pay I was told that my credit card had already been charged No where in the eight hotels I had booked for our trip did the hotel charge my credit card without telling me I would not recommend this hotel ,-0.9037

5,Hotel Cavendish, Very old building staff not having a clue about how to serve customers carpet cleanliness was apalling Doors furnitures bathroom were properly dirty The reception desk staff was robotic and made us unconfortable at the check in They are not interested in give a good impression to customers because the location is central and they can trap a lot of tourists The quality of the breakfast was poor and the table wasn t even completed with pots and cutleries Members of staff in the breakfast room were rude and not helping Outside of the window of the breakfast room there was a gas station with NO SMOKING sign and a builder contractor was smoking at no more than a meter away Also the smell of smoking was coming inside the breakfast room I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone at 115 per night for a triple room The night before a good size rat was calmly scouting the area outside the window ,-0.7952

16,Hotel Cavendish, This place is the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen in my life If I could have imagined that such places exist I would never have booked a room there Booking com was not explicit about the type of room I was being offered and the price did not indicate what I was going to find on arrival What I was offered was not a room but a cupboard with a tiny bed in a niche overlooking an overgrown dirty backyard with no light and no ventilation There was no space to open my suitcase even I would not call this a room or offer it for 85 This was a disgrace on the part of both the hotel and your website I did not sleep in the room and of course there was no refund This was the first time I used booking com and I think it will be the last Very poor quality hotel no value for money and no explicit information to customers about the disgraceful state of the so called room that was on offer ,-0.9844

31,Hotel Cavendish, This definitely not a four star hotel We stayed on campsites that were cleaner and safer than this hotel Our room was tiny and had mould all over the wall the window was broken and open to a construction structure that is holding the building from collapsing The tiles in the room bathroom were broken with gaps in the floor We felt very itchy when we were in the room and had bad allergies very dusty and dirty room Staff were incredibly rude and are mainly backpackers or recent arrivals to the UK who completely miss the point of customer service We had an instance where we required assistance in our room and staff just hang up the phone on us 3 times for simply asking whether the hotel provides shampoo and body wash After multiple calls we were informed they forgot to order any usually I ll be ok with this but not sure why they hang up in our face We had to walk through the kitchen area to get to our room which feels like an worn out tiny attic Staff were very noise because of gaps in the kitchen ceiling we could hear them speak at random hours at night very loudly They also wake up early for their shift and have random chats outside our door I m shocked that Booking com doesn t verify descriptions and hotel ratings provided and allow a hotel like this to advertise a 4 5 star rating Highly upsetting and concerning ,-0.9091
32,Hotel Cavendish, Frankly the single en suite room was insulting for the price charged The window would not open the cords on the pulley system had been severed and the room was only as wide as the length of a single bed There was hardly room to swing a cat in it I complained to reception about the window and was moved to another single room where the window did open but only because toilet roll was wedged beneath the window to create an opening I was put in a different room for my final second night to compensate which was a much more spacious triple room ,-0.3506
33,Hotel Cavendish, Very dirty the carpets stinks a holiday caravan have bigger toilets and shawers very noice imposible to sleep due to the noice smell and especially the bed was horrendous the patio which you can see from the bedroom window looks like a rubbish storage I travel very often around the world for business and pleasure this hotel is by far the worst hotel ever have the misfortune to visit I will never recommend to any one my night in this hotel was a TORTURE ,-0.8987

42,Hotel Cavendish, The room we were located in was next door to the breakfast room and so we had early wake ups everyday as the staff were setting up and from then on until breakfast had ended The breakfast room was small and couldn t always accommodate all those that were staying as it was always busy on one day us having to wait for an hour for a table to become available The room was also located near the staff entrance from the street and so again was always fairly noisy ,-0.1779
43,Hotel Cavendish, This was a typical budget hotel in London a little drearier and mustier in its furniture and decor than some of the other Gower Street hotels The windows wouldn t stay open so it was impossible to get fresh air and even when the temperature was pleasant outside it was sweltering and stuffy in the room The rooms are very tiny and cramped so if you need to spend any time in your room or hotel to work or attend to business this hotel is not a good choice There is no place to sit besides on the bed itself The poor water pressure was to be expected in a London hotel in this price range The breakfast is pretty standard except for the instant coffee which I found disappointing even in comparison to other hotels in this price range While the bathroom and washable bedding seemed clean the carpets and curtains and decorative pillows badly need to be freshened up I don t think they re dirty exactly but they smell musty and look very worn ,-0.761

173,Hotel Cavendish, Bedroom was above the breakfast area the stench of egg for the whole 3x days ruined the experience I booked the room on booking com but emailed the hotel as instructed by the front desk to request that they charge the credit card given to take my email as authorisation This was ignored and resulted in the guests paying out of their own pocket which was not my request ,-0.4118

3097,Bloomsbury Palace Hotel, Our room was situated so there was a constant through the night noise like a lorry reversing This went on all night I had two hours sleep and ruined the next day as we were all so tired Second thing and this is the thing that would make me never stay again when my husband checked in he was told breakfast was till 10am We arrived at 9 02am a really rude waitress told us we were 2 min late so could not have the cooked breakfast we were really looking forward too She was not even apologetic in her manner just point blank rude When she left the room the other guests also commented on her rudeness to us So unfortunately for us we had a room where a noise kept us up till around 6am we finally had two hours sleep then we re refused breakfat Would never go back and a colleague of mine is cancelling her booking there in August ,-0.9598

3868,Gainsborough Hotel, Tiny single room to be expected but this room was so hot There was a portable air conditioning unit in the room that was so noisy you could hear it when you came out of the lift 5 rooms away Impossible to sleep with the noise of that and the heat when it was turned off The shower also had a lot of black mold in around the tiles and all of the sealer Tiles were cracked and black in between them The bathroom and furniture in the single room leave a lot to be desired and are in desperate need of replacing No way a four star More like two One member of check in staff was also very rude to me They were unable to take card payments when I arrived as there was something wrong with their system She kept telling me to go to a cash point to get cash out to pay for my two nights stay and wanted another 50 cash as a deposit I told her I would do so in a while but wanted to go to my room first as I had a long journey getting to the hotel and wanted to drop my luggage off When I came down about half an hour later she shouted at me across the reception in front of other guests and asked me if I had fixed the problem with my card Not only was this incredibly rude and tactless of her it was also very inappropriate as my card was perfectly fine it was their system that was down She made me feel like some kind of low life When I came back with all of the cash for her she started speaking in a foreign language with the porter I couldnt say of she was talking about me as I didnt know the language The other receptionist then kindly asked them to refrain from doing this as they had a guest present and it was very rude of them to do so Instead of making me feel like a low life they could of easily just taken payment by my card when their system was up again Needless to say I wont be staying there again despite the great location ,-0.9444
3869,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was very small The window in the bedroom did not open The air conditioning was unbearably loud and not incredibly effective so it was oppressively hot preventing any sleep on my first night Fortunately the weather was cooler on my second night so I didn t require the air conditioning ,-0.435

3873,Gainsborough Hotel, Room was a disgrace Have never been anywhere as bad Breakfast a joke No bread left Staff clean the tables by whiping the crumbs on the chairs and floor No wonder they have mice The staff keep picking up the folk used to pick up chesse and ham and lay them down ON THE CHEESE AND HAM Everyones hands touch everyones ham and cheese Beyond stupid I am beyond words frankily,-0.8625

3878,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was out dated chipped paint dirty stained carpet and tapestries and two very small uncomfortable beds We even booked a room to have one bed as we traveled as a couple and were given a tiny hole of a room It would be the equivalent of staying at a Motel 6 in America from the 1980s in the middle of all the museum zone of Washington DC Would not recommend as the price for two nights was close to 365 in US currency Spend the extra 200 or more and stay at one of the nicer hotels in the area ,-0.6109

3889,Gainsborough Hotel, Tired decor Wallpaper missing toilet leaking tiny room large a c unit and a huge gap at the bottom of the room door all gave a poor impression I was expecting a 4 star hotel and a 4 poster bed in our deluxe double room instead we had 2 singlebeds pushed together which took up most of the room space The receptionstaff were good and very helpful The breakfast staff were indifferent bordering on rude Breakfast was OK but not the best All in all although it served its purpose the hotel was not what I was expecting and certainly does not deserve to call itself a 4 star hotel ,-0.3376
3890,Gainsborough Hotel, The room was so tiny that you could not fully open your suitcase except for on the bed Getting in and out of the bathroom was a shuffle and dance and the sink so minuscule that you could hardly do anything with it The size of the room or rather lack thereof was only topped by the heat in there Despite a mere 23 C outside it was stuffy and hot all day and all night although I had opened the window as much as possible Horrible ,-0.7003

4765,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The noise from staff ALL morning and afternoon outside of my room room 102 was loud and frustrating as I just wanted to relax and sleep but couldn t because all I heard was the conversations and doors opening and closing Selection of TV channels was limited I asked for Sausages Baked Beans and Hash browns for breakfast and I got given Bacon instead of Hash Browns I was too hungry to have to request to swap for the right items I wanted to use the iron however after I had put water in it it began to leak so therefore I opted against it which left me looking scruffy as I couldn t iron my outfit as intended On our second night the bar staff made myself and my partner uncomfortable as I was told upon arrival at the hotel that my stay included a meal allowance but I could potentially use it towards drinks in the bar but mainly because I got there when dinner had finished as we had plans to have dinner at another venue on our 2nd night I thought that perhaps we may be able to use the allowance towards drinks instead However the lady behind the bar was very confused The query was resolved and we ended up just paying for our drinks I have to use a straw and there were only 5 available to use It sounds like a minor issue but as there was only 4 people in the bar area and 2 members of on duty bar staff you d think the small details would be manageable Also herself a chap also working behind the bar and another staff member who I think was off duty were chatting among themselves which was very awkward as customer service wasn t a priority Overall after paying 267 for 2 nights upon arrival at the hotel I just can t say it was worth such an amount ,-0.7863

5319,Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, I choose this hotel only because before booking I read that they have FREE shuttle to airport After booking there was written that shuttle is for additional cost When I arrived to hotel I found out that shuttle buss starts only from 09 00 so beware that this hotel thinks that peoples don t fly in the mornings Taxi from hotel to airport we found out from reception that it costs 140 euros And to get from hotel to airport in the morning it s huge problem because you need choose multiple metros trains buses My advice for everyone who travels without car choose hotel which is in center because there from central station you can find shuttle for normal money Also in hotel room there was very weird unpleasant smell Left window open all night and still it didn t came out ,-0.1873

7038,Henry VIII, The only thing I felt upset about was I missed breakfast and got the times wrong and asked to be given some in my room and I was told no which was upsetting Apart from that I had no problems ,-0.8733
7039,Henry VIII, 1 Staff need more attention to detail For example reception didn t ask have you stayed before Breakfast is downstairs in the restaurant bar area and at breakfast they took my room number gave me a table and that was it I would have expected them to ask if I knew where everything was rather than feeling you had to fend for yourself I am harsh but have worked in catering and expect a decent standard 2 Food provided for room service is appalling Brakes congealed tomato soup and walkers ready salted crisps no bread roll Was cheap and nasty and charged 7 00 for the pleasure of it I feel if you are going to offer room service do it properly Also room service was advertised between 7 11 and when I rang I was told it wasn t until 8pm No apology given After 8pm it took me six attempts to order as the bar didn t answer If you want to provide guests drinks and don t have the catering staff put in a mini bar I had a cupboard in my room that was a perfect candidate for conversion The menu was mostly drinks which says a lot It made me wish I had gone and bought something from sainsburys 3 Could do with a refurbishment I stayed in 108 and the side of the bath was coming off No carpet in the rooms and makes it feel cheap Advertised as 4 but feels budget if I compare to other 4 hotels I have stayed at 4 No gown or slippers provided for use of spa facilities Reception should warn you of this and how to use pool etc ,-0.1955

7048,Henry VIII, It s very difficult as I don t know where to start 1 all the staff are foreign which is not bad as itself but the problem was they can t speak English at all You expect that the people who work at reception can speak a good English so you can at least check in 2 found staffs are rude from the reception to the kitchen For instance the trainee receptionist was a young guy with glasses can t remember his name but when I asked him to get me his manager he told me that in his wording I m the boss when my manger is not here He was saying this while he was wearing a trainee name badge 3 very old hotel with scary lift 4 the beds are very small and uncomfortable,-0.9147

7056,Henry VIII, I booked a double room but the bed was 3 4 size so not a lot of space room was quite small and at the back adjacent to the exposed tube lines so noisy trains late night and early morning More like a single room than a double The people next door woke us up when they came in at 2am The hot buffet breakfast was cold as it had been out for too long The whole thing was a disappointment and not like our previous stay some years ago I wouldn t go back ,-0.7742

7068,Henry VIII, Room next to train noisy at night Breakfast really basic not for a 4 star 3 star hotel max despite good location,-0.4777
7070,Henry VIII, Even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice When following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable The breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc The lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions Although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm It is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down Even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it All in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided ,-0.9254
7071,Henry VIII, On the first night we were given a room with two single beds room 217 put together even though we requested a double bed The room was dirty and the bed had bed bugs could not sleep all night Next day we changed rooms and moved to 405 which was definitely much better What i disliked about this hotel was the staff especially the manager very unhelpful The hotel charged me twice for the same room and they were unwilling to refund me saying that the reservation was unrefundable which did not make sense as I had already paid it once and was staying at the hotel cleary I showed up for my booking The manager who did not speak good English did not care at all that we were customers and started yelling at us for a mistake that it was theirs I had to contact Booking com to resolve this situation and receive my refund of more than 700 pounds Also a day before my trip to London they contacted me saying that my card details were invalid and that they would cancel my reservation Meanwhile my card was fully charged I had to be with them an hour on the phone so they could find the credit card slip and see that i was already charged Very unhappy Such a shame that this hotel is run by incompetent managers and supervisors ,-0.9453
7072,Henry VIII, Breakfast was a disappointment Although lots of fresh fruit the bacon and scrambled eggs were cold The bread was not always fresh I paid for two single beds but were given a bed for two and I was travelling with my young son ,-0.2455
7073,Henry VIII, The only down point which ruined the start of our day and made us regret booking the hotel as we mainly booked because we could have a morning swim was the fact the swimming pool seemed to be running a toddles swim we went in for half an hour 45 mins during that time 4 toddles had a lesson each one absolutely screamed the house down we normally swim for an hour or so but left early as a child choked so much he was sick spitting water up it wasn t a good start to the day we also wanted to use the sauna but parents were using it as a baby change It was horrible listening to babies choke cry and scream it wasn t on the agenda I believe the hotel should book baby lessons in after 11 as most guest will then head out for the day and at least be able to have a relaxing swim also the instructor had his sister and brother in law in there it felt like we shouldn t of been there despite the fact we paid to stay in the hotel we felt uneasy with the constant children and stares from people it was not a nice experience more like a free public pool then a private pool in a 4 star hotel and is the only thing that would make me not book again,-0.9517

7082,Henry VIII, I have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation They took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further 88 over and above the sum due On talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank My son who is from Scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in London with his bank account wiped out I gave it as a gift and am really angry They still haven t refunded the 88 and I am taking this further I was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments They are a bunch of crooks sorry to say Such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them ,-0.7929

7092,Henry VIII, Solo Traveller TV didn t work whole time I was there Had breakfast option Only one morning out of three did i try to have breakfast and was simply told we are full No attempt to accomodate me They have done pre authorised transactions on my card 4 times So currently in addtion to the bill being paid I currently have another 290 of my funds in my bank account currently reserved by them which I will not get back for another 7 working days,-0.296

7946,London Elizabeth Hotel, The Room was uncomfortably hot and we were not able to sleep all night I had expected an air conditioned room in a four star hotel in fact there was a small ceiling fan providing some air to the feet of the bed beds were too small The carpets were old and seem unclean The breakfast was the worst I have seen from all the hotels booked to booking com The continental breakfast offered some cereals apples boiled egg and cold toasts I will write to you separately requesting for refund because the hotel was not in my opinion a four star accommodation There were at least two guests I met who very upset about the poor the quality of service I requested a table fan during the night because I was unable to sleep but there were none available It appears that even for the guests who have air conditioned rooms the air conditioning has malfunctioned I believe that considering that this was rated as four star it should have been made clear to the guests that in the heat of the summer no air conditioned rooms will be available I would rate our stay at this hotel is the worst experience ever,-0.8792

7955,London Elizabeth Hotel, Extremely uncaring and conceited staff apart from one girl The receptionist meeting us kept measuring us up and we didn t feel welcome at all Once we d entered the hotel corridors we realized they ve put all their money into the lobby The hotel corridors where extremely narrow the lift only fitted one normal size person and one suitcase or two normal sized people The further we went into the hotel the shabbier it got A damp smell of mold caused headaches and it wasn t exactly inviting to a good night sleep Some paint might have covered up some of the worst parts but again they d probably just repaint the lobby instead though I doubt it would cover up dodgy and badly kept corridors floors and walls We ve booked a room with one double bed and a single bed family of 3 but received a room with two single beds and an extra bed We decided to stay after all as we where very tired In the middle of the night we were woken up by a dripping sound and saw water coming down from the ceiling This would explain the very bumpy and uneven floor I suspect the bathroom above us had a leak and probably not for the first time My husband but a bin under it and rushed down to the reception to let them know it was a leak and all they did was to hand him the key to the room next door No assistance in getting us there no rushing to fix the room and no staff coming to ask if we were installed alright in the new room Even worse the snotty receptionist didn t mention this when checking out no apology or even acknowledgment when we told her that we would check out from a different room than the one we checked out from and we told her kindly why Oh OK was all we got The breakfast is a different story Simple continental breakfast with more cakes than food bad coffee and the self service bar was put in a narrow hallway not big enough for two to serve themselves at the time DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE PICTURES ,-0.9671

7967,London Elizabeth Hotel, The wifi was very slow and the hotel furnishings fixtures etc was quite old and a bit shabby Also the window in my room was letting in a bit of a draft and the heat didn t work one night of my stay but they did apologize for this Admittedly I should have reported it as soon as I realized it instead I kept waiting and waiting for it to kick on and it didn t and I just went to sleep The continental breakfast wasn t stellar I ended up just eating a bowl of cereal both mornings but this is par for the course Warning you have to leave your room key when you leave the hotel and when I came back one afternoon I accidentally asked for the wrong room key I was room 335 and I asked for 333 by mistake It was given to me no questions asked no form of ID or checks whatsoever were required to get the room key and I could ve gone into that wrong room and stolen something I realized quite quickly BEFORE going into the wrong room that I didn t have my own key and got the right one but it made me very uncomfortable to think that someone could have done the same thing to my room and stolen my things ,-0.9911
