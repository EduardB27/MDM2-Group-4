Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is placed excellently as it is surrounded by 3 tube stations on different lines and is easily in walking distance of The British Museum and not far from Leicester Square either if you don t mind a stroll We even walked to King s Cross Station from the hotel The staff were really helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage in reception the day we arrived whilst we went exploring the city and offered to hold our luggage on the day we left as well Breakfast was pleasant and the staff were happy to assist Our room was situated at the back of the property and so there was little noise considering the road the hotel is on Overall a pleasant stay and I would recommend it to others who are going to London and want a central but budget friendly hotel

Hotel Cavendish, it was close to Euston Station and easy to get to other areas
Hotel Cavendish, the room is big close to train and tube station good full English breakfast 
Hotel Cavendish, I couldn t find a better location at that price I had the cabin the smallest room I could find and I loved it I didn t need anything more I wish all the hotels had that option The breakfast was ok although I would have liked porridge and they didn t have any The staff was very friendly and helpful I already knew they didn t have a lift so I was prepared with the kind of luggage to carry with me 
Hotel Cavendish, It is a very central location and therefore good for tourists or if like me you go to Camden on nights out it is a fairly affordable option for staying the night instead of a long night bus or night tube journey home Facilities are also pretty good and staff are friendly 
Hotel Cavendish,No Positive
Hotel Cavendish, It was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore British Museum British Library University of London and very walkable to areas around The double room was small but comfortable for one person It could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily The reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay there again

Hotel Cavendish, Staff friendly
Hotel Cavendish, The location is great it s an easy walk to both the Goodge and Warren tube stations I have no comment on the breakfast as I only had toast My room a single was extremely small but that s a warning more than a criticism It s not uncommon for British hotels to have very small rooms 
Hotel Cavendish, We liked the location to central London 
Hotel Cavendish, I visited the Cavendish with my wife last weekend we had a wonderful stay We where greeted by Omar who was very friendly and was always at hand to help and make our stay happy and relaxing and telling us the best places to go locally At breakfast the staff was ensuring we was well fed and comfortable and served a lovely English breakfast although there is a lovely choice if you prefer a choice The hotel is well placed and only a short walk from Euston Station It is within reach of all of London s famous areas to visit within a 20 minute walk or a short walk to an underground station We both found the hotel a comfortable place to stay and it was the the staff made it that way always asking are the rooms ok and comfortable I would recommend this place to stay in London it is ideal for weekend breaks Thank you Omar and the staff you do a great job at making sure our stay was a lovely one regards Ian
Hotel Cavendish, Breakfast The breakfast was very good Full English breakfast eggs at our own likings beans bacon sausage tomato coffee tea toasts jams There s also options for cereals n some fruits n juices Location The location was very good Close distance to all the major tube stations Warren St Station Euston Sq Station and Euston Railway St It s also about 15min walk to this one intersection where there s a lot of good food we ate at Kanada Ya Ramen Bar highly recommended if you like asian noodle soup It s about 10 15min walk from British Museum The bus stop across the street also goes to Trafalgar Sq which we took to get amazing deal on the Lion King Show Staffs The staff made were nice we arrived around 10pm he saw that I was pregnant so he switched us into a bigger room Rooms They clean the room everyday make bed replace towels There s also kettle n tea coffee in the room n some crackers which I believe they were complimentary

Hotel Cavendish, The location of this property is great It s convenient to St Pancras Station the British Library the British Museum and many other delights of Bloomsbury For a short stay in which you plan to be out sightseeing all day and evening and only need a place to sleep at night the Hotel Cavendish would be a good base One advantage it has over some of the other Gower Street hotels is that the windows are double paned so that the street noise was reduced There was also a fan in the room which was useful because the room was very close and stuffy The wireless was speedier and more reliable than some other budget hotels I ve stayed in There was very little noise audible through the walls which was a relief as this is sometimes a problem in these older hotels

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The hotel is relatively not far from the commercial area where IKEA Auchan KIABI and other stores are located There is also a transfer to some city locations seems it is a metro station in the morning and in the evening Ostrich geese farm nearby by you cannot get close to them Desserts were rich
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Everything was upto the mark except the parking staff which were extremely rude
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, It has a modern look on the exterior as well as the interior
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, The day we could finally check out 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Excellent information by reception speaking English proficiently on how to get to the city centre Easy access to centre of Milan by catching the hotel transport to San Siro underground station and thereafter underground trains cost only 1 50 one way Hotel great value for money as city centre hotels extremely expensive Secure car parking on site for 8 a day although reviews suggest otherwise Perhaps different when it s a Milan football match Breakfast was good although very busy Beware of mosquitoes especially waiting at night time by San Siro underground for the hotel transport maybe unusual for this time of year but bitten a lot 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Breakfast was included great value for money 
Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, For this price it was perfect Although it is quite far from the city center transport connection is really OK If you are looking for good a hotel in Milan where you can have enough breakfast to begin your day you rather travel 20 minutes more than pay hight prices this place is for you

Idea Hotel Milano San Siro, Value for money is exceptional and although the location is pretty horrendous every effort is made to help the guest and with a bit of patience it turned out to be the right place for us The rooms are 4 star the restaurant isn t however the breakfast was free and was edible My son and I like our own space so to get two rooms for under 100 was fantastic and we would stay there again especially now we understand the public transport system better The staff were very good and as helpful as they could be Public areas were bright and offered a lot of space but were very warm
