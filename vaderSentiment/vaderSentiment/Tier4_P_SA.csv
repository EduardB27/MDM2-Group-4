0,Hotel Cavendish, The hotel is placed excellently as it is surrounded by 3 tube stations on different lines and is easily in walking distance of The British Museum and not far from Leicester Square either if you don t mind a stroll We even walked to King s Cross Station from the hotel The staff were really helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage in reception the day we arrived whilst we went exploring the city and offered to hold our luggage on the day we left as well Breakfast was pleasant and the staff were happy to assist Our room was situated at the back of the property and so there was little noise considering the road the hotel is on Overall a pleasant stay and I would recommend it to others who are going to London and want a central but budget friendly hotel ,0.9485

13,Hotel Cavendish, I couldn t find a better location at that price I had the cabin the smallest room I could find and I loved it I didn t need anything more I wish all the hotels had that option The breakfast was ok although I would have liked porridge and they didn t have any The staff was very friendly and helpful I already knew they didn t have a lift so I was prepared with the kind of luggage to carry with me ,0.9702

16,Hotel Cavendish, It was very convenient to two tube stops grocery bookstore British Museum British Library University of London and very walkable to areas around The double room was small but comfortable for one person It could have used a deep clean around the baseboards sill and doors but otherwise was well attended to daily The reception area could use some work as it doesn t leave a good impression but in the end it was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful I would stay there again ,0.9804

44,Hotel Cavendish, The location of this property is great It s convenient to St Pancras Station the British Library the British Museum and many other delights of Bloomsbury For a short stay in which you plan to be out sightseeing all day and evening and only need a place to sleep at night the Hotel Cavendish would be a good base One advantage it has over some of the other Gower Street hotels is that the windows are double paned so that the street noise was reduced There was also a fan in the room which was useful because the room was very close and stuffy The wireless was speedier and more reliable than some other budget hotels I ve stayed in There was very little noise audible through the walls which was a relief as this is sometimes a problem in these older hotels ,0.9485
